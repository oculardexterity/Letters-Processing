<salute>My dearest Pierce,</salute>
<p>I hope you got through<lb/> your journey to Dublin <lb/> <sic>allright</sic>.  We were hoping <lb/> to have a line from you; <lb/> I have no doubt it will<lb/> come in a day or so.  The<lb/> weather was, I think, pleas&#x2014;<lb/>ant for travelling, and I <lb/>dare say the sea was fairly<lb/> calm.  If you had gone <lb/> the previous day you would <lb/> have found it pretty rough, if <lb/>one may judge from the con&#x2014;<pb/>
           
                <pb n="487" facs="a5735d1ea76635fbab877c9c43404716.jpg"/>
                dition of the <unclear>waves</unclear>. We are <lb/> both well, thank God, but have<lb/> no news.  There can be no <lb/> doubt that the women here<lb/> are taking advantage of the<lb/> chances offered them.  They are <lb/> crowding into all the out&#x2014;<lb/>door employments in which <lb/> their services are demanded and <lb/> in a great many of the offi&#x2014;<lb/>ces they are performing the <lb/> work of clerks and book&#x2014;<lb/>keepers.  They are getting very <lb/>good wages, but not such high <lb/>pay as the men whom they re&#x2014;<lb/>place got.  It is probable there <lb/> will be ructions on the subject <lb/> after the war. </p>  
<p>Take good care of your health <lb/> and write.</p>
<salute>With fondest love from mother and myself,<lb/>
Ever affectionately</salute> Father.
