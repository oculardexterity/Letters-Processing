                        <p>Letter from Marie Martin to her mother Mary Martin (n√©e Moore). Marie (1892-1975) was later the founder of the Medical Missionaries of Mary.

<salute>My very dearest mother,</salute>
<p>Ever so many<lb/> thanks for your letters. I am<lb/> very distressed to hear of<lb/> all your worry &amp; trouble<lb/> with the mumps etc. but<lb/> was delighted to receive<lb/> your card saying they were<lb/> all better. When you are so<lb/> busy &amp; worried just get<lb/> someone to drop me a card<lb/> to say how you all are.<lb/></p>
<p>It is too bad about Jack<lb/> I cannot quite understand<lb/> how his temperature goes up<lb/> he really does not seem<lb/> very strong. I shall write<lb/> you a long letter in my<lb/> off time to-day but want<lb/> this to catch the post<pb/>
           
                <pb n="3192" facs="2e1c52d6bcea54c664b4e58068d569bf.jpg"/>
                It must be a great upset<lb/> to Ethel but a great use<lb/> to you to have her at<lb/> home. Have you had another<lb/> cold, do take care of your-<lb/> self. Hoping you continue<lb/> to have good news of<lb/> Tommy.</p><lb/>
<salute>My fondest love in<lb/> great haste<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Marie</hi></salute>
