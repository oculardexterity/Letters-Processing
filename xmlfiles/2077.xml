                        <p>This letter is part of a rich correspondence between various members of the Duffin family, a large prosperous family living in  Strandtown, Belfast. Several family members served in the war, including Major Terence Duffin, who served as a staff officer with 107 Brigade, and later with Royal Irish Rifles; Major Charles G Duffin MC, Royal Field Artillery; and their sisters Emma, Celia and Dorothy who served as Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADS) in Egypt and France, and with theYMCA.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>In this four page letter, Helen Duffin (b.1891) is writing to her sister Celia who is ill and who cannot be with the family for Christmas. Helen tells Celia about an &#34;odd&#34; incident she had with an unexpected visitor to her office: a little man with a &#34;pale face&#34; and a &#34;fuz of red hair&#34; who is looking for some contributions to a poetry book for which Lavery (possibly John Lavery, the painter) is also providing a drawing. The man has requested that Celia provide a poem for the volume and their sister Ruth is also sending him one.  At the end of the letter Helen encloses a humorous sketch.</p>

<salute>My dear Celia,</salute>

<p>It is folly to wish you<lb/> a Merry Christmas if you are<lb/> going to spend it in bed,<lb/> but I don't want only to<lb/> wish you a 'comfortable' <lb/>Christmas! I wish you could <lb/>walk home for a few days.</p>
<p>This morning in the office<lb/> I was so amused &#x2014; the

                office boy walked in and<lb/> asked if I would see Mr.<lb/>Gregory, the architect. I could <lb/>not think who he was at <lb/>first, but said I would see<lb/> him &amp; then the oddest<lb/> little man walked in<lb/> &amp; introduced himself as<lb/> 'Padraig Gregory' from the <lb/>office opposite! He has<lb/> a little pale face &amp;<pb/> has a fuz of red hair &#x2014; do<lb/> you know his look? He <lb/>asked if I were Ruth or<lb/> Edith &amp; I denied being<lb/> either &amp; then he went on<lb/> to explain that he was<lb/> editing a volume of poetry<lb/> for the <del>St</del> Hospital (St. <lb/>Dunstans) for blind soldiers<lb/> &amp; wanted you to contribute.<lb/>All the <hi rend="underline">best</hi> Ulster people<lb/> are to be represented &amp; <lb/> and Lavery is doing a drawing.<pb/>

                Ruth says she will send <lb/>him 'something'. I had not<lb/> time to read 'The <unclear>dog</unclear> Collection', but it looked<lb/> very fine. You are getting<lb/> quite famous. We feel <lb/>quite a crowd now &amp; Ruth<lb/> comes to-morrow. Poor D is<lb/> very depressed. I am so<lb/> glad you have got a nice<lb/> girl in your room. We <lb/>had a letter from Harry<lb/> to-day (enclosed) &#x2014; please return<lb/> to us.</p>
