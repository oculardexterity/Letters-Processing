                        <p>The letter is a facsimile copy of a letter written by Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). Casement spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. He succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Believing the German support was insufficient, Casement travelled to Ireland to prevent the planned rebellion but was arrested after in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. He was hanged in London in August 1916.</p>
                    
                        <p>The letter was written from Munich and refers mainly to Casement&#39;s sister who was soon to turn 60. Casement is grieved at having to leave again without seeing his sister and leaving her dependent on &#39;strangers&#39;. He notes that she had been &#39;hunted out of Ireland&#39; the previous year and had to go to America. He is also grieved that he cannot tell her anything of what he is doing.</p>
