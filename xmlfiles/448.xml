                        <p>The letter is from Count George Noble Plunkett (1851-1948) to his daughter Geraldine (b. 1891). Count Plunkett has a nationalist and a papal count. He had been sworn in to the IRB by his son, Joseph Mary Plunkett (1887-1916), before the Rising and arrested afterwards. Joseph was a signatory of the proclamation of the Irish republic and was executed for his part in the Rising. Count Plunkett was elected as an MP in 1918 and was a member of the first DÃ¡il. The letter is from Richmond Barracks where he was being held. He requests food, makes reference to a visit by Geraldine that &#39;lifted his heart&#39; and the &#39;joy&#39; of being clean. He also asks that she communicates with her mother, who had also been arrested.</p>

<p>Some sandwiches,<lb/> and apples or oranges would be<lb/> a Godsend to me. Also <add>a small tumbler little mirror,</add> some matches, <add>&amp;<lb/> stamps.</add></p>
