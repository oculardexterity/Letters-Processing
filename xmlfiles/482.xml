                        <p>The letter is from playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) to Gertrude Parry (n√©e Bannister). Bannister was a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister and Shaw were heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. The letter refers to an enclosure that has not survived and a letter by Shaw that was refused for publication in the Times and Daily News newspapers.</p>
                    
                        <p>Casement was hanged in London in August 1916.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Bannister</salute>
<p>Read the enclosed, which you need not return. Shorter is married<lb/> to Dora Sigerson : hence his sympathy. I have told him that you have<lb/> copies of three other petitions. Please send him copies of them : he might<lb/> get signatures.</p>

<p>Both the Times & the Daily News refuse my letter : the D.N.<lb/> because it wishes to prevent the sentence being carried out and the T. probably<lb/> for the opposite reason.</p>

<salute>Yours sincerely</salute>
G. Bernard Shaw.
