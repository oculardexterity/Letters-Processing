                        <p>This letter is from a collection Patrick English, who at the time of writing was a prisoner in Stafford Prison and Frongoch internment camp.</p>
                    
                        <p>In this letter, Kate English writes to inform her son, Patrick, that she received his letter and how happy she was to get it.  She mentions that Patrick&#39;s cousin, Mickie is serving at the front and was surprised when he heard of the trouble.  She tells him to let the officer in charge of him that he has six cousins who are fighting in France, and lists them.</p>
