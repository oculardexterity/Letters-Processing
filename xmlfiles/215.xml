<salute>Dear Jim,</salute> 
<p>I have just got your P.C.<lb/>
I am awfully sorry you are <lb/>
going to Wales, because in that<lb/> 
case I'll never hear from <lb/>
you again. you will be with <lb/>
my Dad. You ought look <lb/>
him up if possible. I do not <lb/>
know how to describe him as <lb/>
I am sure he has changed <lb/>
altogether, with beard and<lb/> other hirsute attachments, but<lb/> 
his number is 306. Tell him <lb/>
to let me know if you get <lb/>
my letter, 'cos its no good writ&#x2014;<lb/>
ing if they don't get there.</p>
<p>Well the old exams are<pb/>

<!-- Next section is written sideways across top of page -->
it mounted and<lb/> enshrined when<lb/> I refind it.<lb/> I'll write<lb/> again some<lb/> time soon. Love to all the<lb/> people I know<lb/> and even to those<lb/> I don't know<lb/>. I don't mind<lb/> "picking up you"<lb/> people. Its not<lb/> like the ordinary<lb/> thing.</p> 
<salute>Love from</salute>
Mary M

                over and luckily I passed.<lb/> 
Indeed Miss very unkindly <lb/>
remarked that it was the<lb/>
 triumph of idleness. I believe <lb/>
she saw you all &#x2014;looking very <lb/>
pretty with lovely flowing <lb/>
<sic>moustachios</sic>, you must look <lb/>
sweet. You no longer <lb/>
resemble me in that case<lb/>
&#x2014;I don't mean in the latter <lb/>
case.</p>
<p>I stayed in town for a week <lb/>
after the results, and only<lb/> 
arrived home last night, and <lb/>
of course this corner of the <lb/>
world is about the dullest <lb/>
part of it in which to be <lb/>
at large. I think its terrible <lb/>
for us to be bored, while we <lb/>
have our freedom. We should <lb/>
give it up altogether &#x2014;but I <lb/>
am afraid it is not easy. </p>
<p>I was looking at the results <lb/>
of the final and I am afraid <lb/>
that the only one I remember<pb/>
           
                <pb n="536" facs="f8036ee219d2c92142fa82ddbb6df658.jpg"/>
                is Dolittle &#x2014;the name took <lb/>
my fancy so completely, but <lb/>
I don't think there were more <lb/>
than 8 names up. A girl <lb/>
got first place as usual. Wait <lb/>
till you see me with the <lb/>
Birmingham gold medal for <lb/>
anatomy next year. I'll take <lb/>
you all to dinner in Jammets <lb/>
to celebrate the occasion. If <lb/>
you prefer anywhere else you <lb/>
can let me know before then<lb/>
and I'll make sure that it <lb/>
will be arranged as you wish.</p>
<p>I believe there is a terrible<lb/> 
crowd of you now in Frongoch. <lb/>
If you heard all the attempts <lb/>
to pronounce that name! I spent <lb/>
about 10 minutes getting lessons<lb/>
 in it from Father Paul, and <lb/>
in the end I had to think very<lb/>
 hard even before second venture <lb/>
on saying it. Mary <unclear>Mouyey</unclear><lb/>
had a letter from Desmond<pb/>

                Ryan the other day. Of course <lb/>
I read it although I had never <lb/>
seen the youth in question. He <lb/>
sent a great collection of extracts <lb/>
from "Barrack room Ballads" <lb/>
so to speak. I hope you will <lb/>
be all out next year. I am <lb/>
dying to see all the people whose<lb/>
names I know so well now. <lb/>
I was going to ask you a list<lb/>
of questions but of course it <lb/>
is no use as they are destined <lb/>
to remain unanswered, even <lb/>
before they are formulated.<.p>
<p>I believe there are occasional <lb/>
calls on your medical  skill,<lb/>
and I heard you also had <lb/>
athletic possibilities. I always <lb/>
thought you were too good a stud<lb/>
ent to do anything but culti<lb/>
vate your  mind. I have the<lb/> 
<sic>refree</sic> whistle I took from you <lb/>
at your dance yet. I must get<pb/>
