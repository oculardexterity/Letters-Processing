                        <p>This is a list of demands written by Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), one of the executed leaders of the Rising. MacDonagh was a poet and teacher. A leading member of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, he was one of the principle organizers of the Easter Rising and one of the seven signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. He was executed on 3 May 1916.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>This note was conveyed to the commanding officer of Richmond Barracks by Father Columbus. Later, in his &#39;My experiences in the 1916 Rising by Father Columbus OSFC&#39;  he wrote about how this came into his possession: </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>&#39;As he [MacDonagh] was second in command he asked me to go as his delegate and to demand to have them recognised as prisoners of war; and to get the rights of such. The he wrote down for the several headings he wished me to have seen to. These I proposed to submit to the officer in charge of the barracks, to see what could be immediately righted for them; and then to go on to Dublin Castle. Here is the document as it lies before meâ€™.</p>
