                Copy<lb/>
of letter received from<lb/> 
Rt. Hon. Sir Henry A. Robinson, Bart., P.C., K.C.B.,<lb/>
Vice&#x2014;Chairman, Local Government Board,<lb/>
<lb/>re&#x2014;

<hi rend="underline">"THE SPANCEL OF DEATH."</hi><lb/>
Note: Sir Henry A. Robinson expressed a wish to read the Play,<lb/>
as his wife, Lady Robinson [<hi rend="underline">nee</hi> Miss Harriet Lynch&#x2014;Blosse]<lb/>
is one of the present&#x2014;day representatives of the Lynch&#x2014;<lb/>
Blosse family, to affect one of the early members of which<lb/> 
[Sir Harry] the spell was performed.]

<address>"Lisnacarrig,<lb/>
Foxrock,<lb/>
Co. Dublin,</address> <date>2nd April, 1916.</date>

<salute>"My <sic>sear</sic> Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your play and think it is the most<lb/>
powerful and dramatic thing I have ever read. It held me spell&#x2014;<lb/>
bound.</p>

<p>I wonder if the Abbey people have any women in their<lb/>
Company capable of doing justice to the part of Sibby Cottle?<lb/>
It would need a Maire O'Neill.</p>

<p>My wife remembers Biddy Holian, &#x2014; the last of the<lb/>
<sic>witche's</sic> race, and she had a bad name &#x2014; an inheritance, I suppose,<lb/>
from Judy.</p>

<p>Old Sir Harry Lynch&#x2014;Blosse's evil reputation is a <lb/>
tradition in the family even now; and my wife tells me that when<lb/>
her father's generation suffered from gout, or other ailment, or<lb/>
misfortune, they always regarded it as a visitations for the sins<lb/>
of Sir Harry.</p>

<p>There is one little mistake you make which is a pity<lb/>
in a story which is otherwise historically accurate. You make<pb/>
           
                <pb n="629" facs="96acedeb01869b062b6df3766ef6f4f3.jpg"/>
                Lord Oranmore the person who is arranging the marriage with<lb/>
Altamount's daughter. Now, the Oranmore peerage was only created<lb/>
in 1836, and Sir Harry's period was nearly 100 years earlier.</p>

<p>The play will create a great sensation if properly<lb/>
staged. The dialogue is so natural that I can almost hear the<pb/>
people speaking.</p>

<p>Wishing you every luch with it, and with many thanks for<lb/> 
your courtesy in letting me see it,</p>

<salute>I remain,<lb/>
Yours sncy,</salute>
H.A. Robinson.

<p>I omitted to mention that my wife doesn't see any reason why <lb/>
any of her family should object to the play. I will register it<lb/>
and send it back to&#x2014;morrow.</p>
