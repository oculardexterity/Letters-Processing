                        <p>The letter is from James Stephens to John MacDonagh and refers to the posthumous publication of some of the poems of Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), one of the signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, executed for his part in the Easter Rising.</p>
                    
                        <p>Stephens writes to John (a brother of Thomas) that all the poems he sent can be published. He notes that he did not &#39;care for&#39; some of the poems and others were &#39;carelessly written&#39; and would have been reworked by MacDonagh if he had lived but they should be preserved. He also suggests a later, &#39;representative&#39; edition of MacDonagh&#39;s work. The collection was edited by Stephens and published later in the year under the title &#39;The Poetical Works of Thomas MacDonagh&#39;.</p>
                    
                        <p>James Stephens (1880?-1950) was a writer who witnessed the events of the Easter Rising and published a famous account, &#39;The Insurrection in Dublin&#39;.</p>
                    
                        <p>John MacDonagh (1880-1961) was an actor, playwright and theatre manager who fought under Thomas during the Rising and later worked for RTE.</p>

                <salute>Dear Mr MacDonagh</salute>
<p>I have read through the<lb/> poems you left with me<lb/> &amp; think that they might be<lb/> all printed. A few of them<lb/> I do not care for, &amp; some are<lb/> very carelessly written &#x2014; Tommy<lb/> would have settled them if he<lb/> had lived. But in this edition<lb/> it is better to preserve all that<lb/> can be preserved, and, later on,<lb/> a selection might be made from<lb/> his verse which would be representative<lb/> of our poor friend at his best. I hope the<lb/> publishers will let me have a proof<lb/> of the few lines I wrote as preface.<lb/></p>
<salute>Yours very truly</salute>
James <hi rend="underline">Stephens</hi>

<!-- Written sideways down the right hand side of the page -->
<note>By the way, the bulk of them of them were written three or four years<lb/> ago for I remember him repeating them to me</note>
