                        <p>This Christmas card contains a brief message from Laurence Browne (1896 - 1916) to his sisters Mary and Nellie. Lawrence was a gunner in the Royal Marine Artillery. On 31 May 1916 the HMS Defence was sunk during the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the Great War, and Lawrence was killed. His body was never recovered.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>This card was written on board the H.M.S. Defence. Lawrence sends his love to his sisters and writes that he was on his way to Malta or the Dardanelles.</p>
