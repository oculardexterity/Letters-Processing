                        <p>Fr Willie Doyle SJ (1873-1917) was an Irish Jesuit who served as a chaplain and died in the First World War. Willie volunteered as a military chaplain and was accepted in November 1915. He began with the 8th Battalion of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, 16th Irish Division.  In April 1916 he was recommended for the Military Cross (MC) for helping to dig wounded men out of a collapsed shelter under fire. He transferred to the 8th Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers around Christmas, 1916. Although there are differing opinions on his date of death (whether the 16 or 17 August 1917), he was killed during the third battle of Ypres while going to the aid of a wounded man near Frezenberg and his body was never recovered. His name is commemorated on the Tyne Cot memorial, Zonnebeke, Belgium.</p>

                        <p>The postcard from Fr Willie Doyle SJ was sent from the Front to Sister M. Anthony, a Mercy Sister assuring Sister Anthony that he is &#39;ever so well and safe as Cork itself&#39;.</p>
