                        <p>The letter is from Count George Nobel Plunkett (1851-1948) to his daughter Geraldine (b. 1891). Count Plunkett has a nationalist and a papal count. He had been sworn in to the IRB by his son, Joseph Mary Plunkett (1887-1916), before the Rising and arrested afterwards. Count Plunkett was elected as an MP in 1918 and a member of the first Dáil. Joseph was a signatory of the proclamation of the Irish republic and was executed for his part in the Rising. The letter is from Richmond Barracks where he was being held. He refers to some good news delivered to Geraldine by a solicitor, requests some money and thanks Geraldine for food she had sent.</p>

<salute>My Dear Gerry,</salute>
<p>I suppose<lb/> Mr. Mathews has given you<lb/> the good news &#x2014; I should say<lb/> <foreign>"Deo gratias"</foreign> if I were with<lb/> Mammy. I say <foreign>"Deo Gratias"</foreign><lb/> now!</p>
<p>My money is run out, so<lb/> I'd be glad to get £1 in change.<lb/> You've brought me so many<lb/> good things to eat that I should<lb/> be ill if I tried to eat them: and<lb/> now I get hot meals, in plenty.</p> 
<salute>God bless you all &#x2014; <hi rend="underline">with all</hi><lb/> my love. Your affectionate</salute> Father
