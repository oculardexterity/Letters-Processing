                        <p>This letter was written to Seamus Fitzgerald (1896–1972). Fitzgerald was a Cork politician and joined the Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin after Easter Week 1916. He was subsequently arrested and sent to Frongoch, Wales, one of the seven places in which he was interned in later years.</p>

                        <p>In this letter to Seamus his mother Alice counsels him to keep his spirits up for fear &#34;you will make me worse than what I am&#34;. She hopes his friends will be sent to the same place so they could be company for him. His father has not been told of Seamus&#39; arrest</p>
