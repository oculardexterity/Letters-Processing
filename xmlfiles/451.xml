                        <p>The letter is a facsimile copy of the first page of a letter written by Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was in Germany. He spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. Casement succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Believing that German support was insufficient, Casement travelled to Ireland to prevent the planned rebellion but was arrested after landing in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising and was hanged in London in August 1916.</p>
                    
                        <p>The letter is critical of the &#39;transparent lies and obnoxious boastings&#39; or some unnamed people, which he believes as symptoms of a &#39;John Bull&#39; (i.e. English) make up.</p>
