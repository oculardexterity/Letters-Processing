<salute>Dear Mr. Yeates</salute>
<p>Mr. St. John Ervine tells me<lb/> you have suggested changing the<lb/> names of the characters in "The<lb/> "Spancel of Death" lest their retention<lb/> might cause pain, or give offence,<lb/> to any living descendants of the<lb/> persons dealt with.</p>
 <p>Needless to say I should be exceedingly<pb/>
           
                <pb n="619" facs="2e7a9f4950ceb984a96a15424a0aaf19.jpg"/>
                Sorry to give offence to any one, and<lb/> 
therefore before writing those names
I fully<lb/> considered such a possibility, there<lb/>
was &#x2014; up to about five weeks ago &#x2014; just <lb/>
one person living who might possibly <lb/>
feel agrieved. &#x2014; Miss Lynch&#x2014;Blosse,<lb/>
an old lady of 94 years, who was a<lb/>
great grand niece of Sir Harry Lynch&#x2014;<lb/>
Blosse. But she died at Monkstown<lb/>
about five or six weeks ago, and there<lb/>
is no one else left. As for Sibella<lb/>
Cottle, all the remains of her is merely<lb/>
a memory. She was not a native<lb/>
in the district. Neither was she a<lb/>
peasant. There remains then but the<pb/>
name of the old peasant sorceress<lb/> Judy Holian. and whilst there<lb/> are still some peasant descendants<lb/> of remote kinship to her they most<lb/> certainly would not claim the<lb/> connection.</p> 
<p>Beyond all this, <del>all</del> the names<lb/> mentioned by me are given in<lb/> Archdeacon's book, published some<lb/> sixty years ago, and subscribed for<lb/> at the time by the then existing<lb/> Lynch Blosses, Moores. Blakes and<lb/> others whose names happen to<lb/> occur in "The Spancel of Death"</p> 
<p>The rather gloried in the notoriety</p> 
<p>You may possibly remember<lb/> also that Mrs Tynan Hinksom<pb/>
           
                <pb n="620" facs="e27076a456de3cd8fda509f89f997d3d.jpg"/>
                at that time &#x2014; K.Tynan &#x2014; published a<lb/>
story dealing with the same<lb/>
incidents and giving the correct<lb/>
names. I happened to tell her the<lb/>
story once at Whitehall and she<lb/>
subsequently published it in some<lb/>
local journal. I remember she<lb/>
did not change the names. So I <lb/>
really do not think it necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, if you still think otherwise<lb/> I shall, <hi rend="underline">but with regret</hi>, part with<lb/>
the names; for they are dear to me.</p>
<p> You might please let me know as<lb/> 
the play has not yet been put into<lb/> 
rehearsal.</p>
<salute>Yours Sincerely</salute>
T.H. <hi rend="underline">Nally</hi>.
