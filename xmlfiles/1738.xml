                        <p>This letter was addressed to John Francis Hogan (1858–1918). Hogan was a priest, author, and president of St Patrick&#39;s College, Maynooth. </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>During the Easter Rising a group of Volunteers from the town of Maynooth entered the college to seek a blessing before setting off for Dublin. Hogan reputedly refused to give his blessing to their ‘foolish and most ill-advised expedition’ and urged them to return home. They in turn refused; responding to their spiritual needs, he blessed them, while remaining totally opposed to their activities. He subsequently addressed the students on the need to show proper respect for authority.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>In this letter Rev Waters (b. 1871)  is asking Hogan for information about the programme of examination for a bachelor of arts degree in Theology at Maynooth so his students can prepare themselves properly.</p>

July <hi rend="underline">2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 16</hi>
<salute>My Dear Monsignor Hogan,</salute>
<p>Some of our students <lb/>who are going down to Maynooth <lb/>next year would naturally join <lb/>your <hi rend="underline">Ba class 2</hi>nd year, as <lb/>they have already done the Ba <lb/>course 1st year (corresponding to the <lb/>old 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Arts) at University College./p>
<p>There is no programme publish-<lb/>ed of Subjects for Examination <lb/>for <lb/>this class in Maynooth &#x2014; as far as</p>
<pb/>
           
                <pb n="4333" facs="07f44d1db5f348c8c1f832cc05763cdc.jpg"/>
                <p>I know. In the '<foreign>Ordo</foreign>,' there is the <lb/>programme of Examination for <lb/>admission into Ba degree class <lb/><hi rend="underline">First</hi> year, and into <hi rend="underline">First years <lb/>Theology</hi>, but none for admission <lb/>into the class between these two, i.e., <lb/>into <hi rend="underline">Ba degree class second year.</hi> <lb/>There is no <unclear>bad</unclear> to candidates <lb/>coming to Maynooth for this class.</p> 
<p>I should feel very grateful if you <lb/>would send me information about <lb/>the programme, as our students <lb/>would like to prepare themselves <lb/>for the Examination. If you kindly send <lb/>me the details I will communicate <lb/>these to students.</p>
<salute>Kindest Regards<lb/>
Yours Sincerely</salute>
