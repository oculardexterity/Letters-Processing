                        <p>The letter is from Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath (1841-1929), to Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock. Meath requests Clonbrock to form a committee representing &#39;loyal Ireland&#39; (those in Ireland loyal to the British Crown) to oversee the &#39;R.I.C. and Police Fund&#39; in Galway and to contribute personally to the fund an amount that would encourage others to do likewise.</p>
                    
                        <p>The Irish Police &amp; Constabulary Recognition Fund was founded by Meath to recognise the work of the police during the Easter Rising. It presented certificates, war bonds and awards to policemen who were in active service in the Royal Irish Constabulary or Dublin Metropolitan Police during the Rising and compensation to the widows and dependants of those killed or injured.</p>
