                        <p>This is a letter from Samuel Alex Wray (b.1875), a solicitor, to Henry Arthur Wynne (1867-1945), the chief crown solicitor for Ireland. In the letter, Wray states he is the solicitor for Professor Valentine Steinberger (b.1853), a German professor in University College Galway who was arrested in Galway following the Easter Rising and deported to Wandsworth prison, and his wife Elizabeth Steinberger (b. 1858). Wray states that he wishes to consult Steinberger regarding his half of the rent payment, also requesting to be informed of Steinberger&#39;s whereabouts.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I act as solicitor and agent for Professor Steinberger of<lb/>
Belmore Galway and his wife who are joint owners of some house<lb/>
property in this town. My custom after completion of my collection<lb/>
of the May and November rents has been to send a statement, and a<lb/>
cheque for one half of amount payable, to each. Following upon the<lb/>
Sinn Fein rebellion the Professor has been arrested and I would<lb/>
be glad to hear from you if there would be any objection on the part<lb/>
of the Crown to my remitting to him his half of the rents or taking <lb/>
his instructions as to the disposal thereof and, if there is no such<lb/>
objection, I would feel obliged if you would tell me where he is now<lb/>
to be found.</p>
<salute>Yours faithfully,</salute>
Samuel A. Wray<lb/>
The Chief Crown Solicitor,<lb/>
Dublin Castle,<lb/>
Dublin.<lb/>

<note>Inform Mr Way that Professor<lb/>
Steinberger is in the custody of <lb/>
the military authorities &amp; that he<lb/>
should apply to them<lb/>
