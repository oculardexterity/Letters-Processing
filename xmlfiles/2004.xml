                        <p>Letter from Robert Monteith (1879-1956), a founder member of the Irish Volunteers, to his wife Mary Florence (Mollie)  Monteith (née McEvoy, 1877-1960). In 1909 Monteith, a Protestant, and McEvoy, a Catholic widow with three children, were married against his family&#39;s wishes. </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>In 1915 Monteith was selected by Thomas Clarke (1858–1916), a veteran of revolutionary politics, to accompany Sir Roger Casement (1864–1916), to Germany to assist with recruitment  of an Irish Brigade from the Irish prisoners-of-war. </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>In this letter, written on Christmas day, Robert expresses loneliness and states that he misses his family. He recalls times they spent together and pleads with his wife to write to him.</p>

<salute>Dear old pet,</salute>
<p>No letter from you yet. I am so <lb/> lonely today - you remember last year <lb/> in 8 Hartstonge St. with the little ones running <lb/> wild &#x2014; why do you grip me so much <lb/> &amp; why are my thoughts so cluttered around <lb/> you? Mollie write me, I do so want your <lb/> sympathy, my work is so hard, and difficulties <lb/> so many - but of course if I had you here to <lb/> tell all my worries to, things would run <lb/> smoothly - I trust you and all at home <pb/>
           
                <pb n="5009" facs="b6ad122b71088b7eec53262038ffa443.jpg"/>
                are enjoying yourselves, even now as I write <lb/> this letter &#x2014;</p>
I cant write more now, fondest love <lb/> Kiss them all for me <lb/>
<salute> Yours ever <lb/>
<unclear>Cara</unclear></salute>
