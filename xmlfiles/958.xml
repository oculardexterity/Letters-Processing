                        <p>This is a postcard sent by Thomas Dolan in Dublin to his father in Derby, England. Dolan was a member of the Northumberland Fusiliers Regiment in the British Army. At the time this card was written he was serving in Dublin. Thomas would go on to serve in Belgium, where he was killed in action on 26 October 1917.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>The postcard was written on 11 May, the day before the final executions of the leaders of the Rising. Tom writes to ensure his father that he is safe and to let him know that he will be staying in Dublin over the summer. The postcard is an image of the destroyed interior of the General Post Office on Sackville (O&#39;Connell) Street.</p>
