                        <p>This letter was written by Denis Hurley (1849 - 1926). Denis was from a farming family in Tawnies, near Clonakilty, County Cork. After emigrating to Carson City, Nevada in the United States in 1873 Denis went on to become one of Carson City&#39;s most prominent citizens. </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>In this letter, Denis writes to his brother, John (b. 1844) who is at home in Cork. He thanks him for the bunch of shamrock and mentions that John&#39;s letter had the honour of &#34;being opened by the censor&#34;. He mentions his hopes that the war will be over soon and refers to some trouble beginning with Mexico.  Additionally, Denis is curious whether any Clonakilty men have destinguished themselves in the war.</p>
