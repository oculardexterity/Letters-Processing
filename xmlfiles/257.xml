<salute>Dear Mother,</salute>

<p>Things have taken a<lb/> decided turn for the better<lb/> now:&#x2014; as you see I have<lb/> been shifted to Lenan.</p>

<p>Yesterday I left Dunree<lb/>went before Medical Board<lb/> in Derry and then came<lb/> out here. The Medical Board <lb/>passed me fit for house<lb/> service. This place so<lb/> far anyway seems grand<pb/>
           
                <pb n="664" facs="6bbd4c7951d095f43b94373fc350f0a0.jpg"/>
                Compared to Dunree.<lb/> Everything much <add>better</add>, though of <lb/>course it's true I've hardly<lb/> had time to test it. I shall<lb/> be here anyway till the<lb/> first and then I may or<lb/> may not go back to Dunree&#x2014&; probably I shall. <lb/>
Now really I've nothing<lb/> more to say. Please<lb/> thank Em &amp; V for their letters I was awfully<pb/> glad to get them. The<lb/> weather though very cold<lb/> is bright and the sun<lb/> quite powerful in the middle of the day.<lb/> I wish I could see old<lb/> Wicklow again.</p>

<p>I have just got Win's<lb/> forwarded from Dunree<lb/> please thank her very<lb/> much.</p>

<p>I have come the conclusion<lb/> that there is really no use<lb/> having relatives unless<pb/>
           
                <pb n="665" facs="009f6b507461b3b2298d279737d39342.jpg"/>
                they make themselves useful<lb/> so I think perhaps if you<lb/> wrote to Gen Arthur about<lb/> me &amp; R.F.C. it would be the<lb/> best. What do you think? I think<lb/> however it's time to wait a week<lb/> or so till I see what happens to<lb/> me here.
</p>

<p>I think most of Win's questions<lb/> are answered. I have read two books and think the <unclear>here </unclear> I may read<lb/> some more<unclear>.</unclear><!-- there has been some damage to the letter which may hide a full stop --> The Mess here is awfully<lb/> comfy and grub splendid and every-<lb/> b<add>o</add>dy <del>deleted text</del> including the Col awfully<lb/> decent and jolly.</p>

<p>I was so delighted Father<lb/> is doing so well. I hope he'll<lb/> soon be out &amp; about again<unclear>.</unclear></p>
<salute><unclear>Your ever - loving</unclear><lb/>
 C.W.W.</salute>

<p>The book on induction coil was a<lb/> small paper <unclear>b</unclear> and I had two<lb/> copies.<p/>
