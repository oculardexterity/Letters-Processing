                        <p>The letter is a facsimile copy of a letter written by Sir Roger Casement. He spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. Casement succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Believing the German support was insufficient, Casement travelled to Ireland to stop the planned rebellion but was arrested after landing in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising and was hanged in London in August 1916.</p>
                    
                        <p>In the letter, Casement mentions that he will be going to Berlin. He also refers to a letter to &#39;H&#39; and to &#39;other contacts&#39;. Presumably with a view to secrecy, names and places are not missing from the letter.</p>
