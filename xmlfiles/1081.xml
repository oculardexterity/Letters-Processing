                        <p>This is a letter from Marie Helena Martin (1892-1975) to her mother Mary Martin (1866-1955) in Dublin. Marie Martin, later known as &#39;Mother Mary&#39;, was a volunteer nurse during the First World War. She served in field hospitals in Malta, Leeds, and France working for the British army and later went on to become the founder of the Medical Missionaries of Mary (MMM). In this letter from the theatre of war, Marie writes home to her mother to talk about family matters. The main reason for her letter is that Marie is letting her mother know that she is doing everything she can to try and find her brother Charlie (1895-1915) who is missing in action. Marie explains all the ways she is going about to locate Charlie and prays for his safety.</p>
