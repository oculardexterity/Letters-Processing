                        <p>This is a letter from Treasa Ní Modhráin (1889-1971) to Eamonn O&#39;Modhráin (Edward Moran) (1881-1954). Eamonn O&#39;Modhráin and his brother, Lughaidh, were arrested along with hundreds of volunteers and republicans soon after the Easter Rising of 1916. Eamonn was eventually sent to Frongoch Prison in Wales. Tresa was a member of Cumann na mBan.</p>
                    
                        <p>Treasa writes to Eamonn about family matters, mentioning his other sisters, Maire, Una and Nancy.</p>

<salute>My dear Eamonn,</salute> 
<p>I hope before you receive this letter that you will<lb/>
have got safely the parcel which Marie forwarded to you<lb/>
and Lughidh this morning. It was only last night we<lb/>
succeeded in finding out where you were gone to.</p>

<p>Immediately on receipt of your post card from Richmond<lb/>
I wrote to Marie and am writing again to-day giving <sic>yu</sic><lb/>
her address.</p>
<p>I <sic>findly</sic> hope you are both keeping well. How did<lb/>
you like your trip across?</p>

<p>Marie returned to Ballysax to-day and will stay there<lb/>
for the present. Nancy has not returned to town yet.</p>

<p>Business is booming with Una. In fact, they are in<lb/>
late almost every night, and worked half a day last<lb/>
Sunday.</p>
<p>The weather is glorious here for the last few days. </p>
<p>Joe starts work on Monday.</p>
<p>I suppose you got a glimpse of the city as you<lb/>
passed through. O'Connell Street is a terrible wreck. <lb/>
None of our places of business suffered at all</p>

                <p>Mother is managing A.1. at home. Uncle Simon gives her <lb/>
great help.</p>
<p><del>Marie has secured a place in Blackpool for Bridgid.<lb/>
Tell Lughaigh I will write to him to&#x2014;morrow.<lb/>
With warmest love to you both, and hoping to see you <lb/>
soon again.</del></p>
