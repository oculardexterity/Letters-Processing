                        <p>This is a mobilisation order sent by William Pearse (1881-1916) to Éamonn Bulfin (1892-1968) on 21 April 1916. William Pearse was a sculptor and brother of Patrick Pearse, one of the leaders of the Easter Rising. William held the rank of captain on the headquarters staff of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers and Bulfin was a member of the Rathfarnham company and had been one of the first pupil&#39;s in Patrick Pearse&#39;s bilingual school for boys, St Enda&#39;s.</p>
                    
                        <p>The order was for the planned manoeuvres on Easter Sunday, 23 April. Unbeknownst to the rank and file, these manouevres were to be used as a cover for the beginning of the Easter Rising but were countermanded by Eoin MacNeill, chief of staff of the Irish Volunteers, when he became aware of the plans. The Rising then went ahead on 24 April with significantly reduced numbers.</p>
                    
                        <p>William Pearse was executed for his part in the Rising on 4 April and Éamonn Bulfin was imprisoned in Stafford and Frongach.</p>
