                        <p>The letter is from Peter McBrien to Geraldine Plunkett Dillon (1891-1986). Geraldine was a sister of Joseph Mary Plunkett, one of the signatories of the proclamation of the Irish republic who was executed for his part in the Easter Rising. The letter refers to a collection of Joseph&#39;s poetry which was posthumously published under the title &#39;The poems of Joseph Mary Plunkett&#39; and edited by Geraldine, who also provided a preface. McBrien praises both the preface and the book.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Dillon,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to be adding to your work and worry at<lb/> such a time as this. Your preface I liked very much; what struck me<lb/> most about it was its homeliness, sincerity, and its sense of the difficulty of reach&#x2014;<lb/>ing to the mastery of his instrument your brother showed. On the<lb/> whole I agree with your criticism of his work, too. The whole<lb/> book is very fine and will live.</p>
<salute>I am, dear Mrs. Dillon,<lb/>
Very gratefully yours,</salute>
Peter McBrien
<p>P.S. : I shall be at Larkfield about 8.15, p.m., next Tuesday, 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. : your sister<lb/> must be blessing me. <hi rend="underline">PMcB.</hi></p>
