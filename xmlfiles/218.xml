                        <p>Copy of a letter from George Gavan Duffy to Michael F.

Thanks Doyle for his ‘splendid efforts’. Underneath, a copy of a letter from Gavan Duffy to Colonel Moore (27 July 1916), in which he states that in Ireland the slanders (about the diaries) are being treated with contempt. Also states that it would not be possible to take any step that would not involve a disagreeable newspaper controversy and would probably do more harm than good.</p>

<address>Michael F. Doyle,</address>

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D.,</salute>

<p>R. C. went to his death like the man he<lb/> was. He died quite fearlessly and proudly.</p> 
<p>It seems hardly conceivable that the<lb/> immense efforts made by his friends here and<lb/> elsewhere cd be in vain, but there is a section<lb/> of politicians here who can learn nothing and<lb/> who will never learn anything. The Misses Ban<lb/> and all his friends are deeply grateful for<lb/> splendid efforts you made on his behalf<lb/> which we can never forget.</p>
. . . .
<salute>Yrs very sincerely,</salute>
G. G. D.

<address>Colonel Moore.</address>
<date>27 July 1916</date>
<p>We over here are treating the slanders<lb/> with contempt. If I could only ascertain<lb/> which Govt Dept. is responsible for<lb/> propagation of story I cd. take<lb/> effective measures but I <del>have</del> <add>so far it has not</add> <lb/><del>not got</del> <address>been possible to get</address> the necessary evidence<lb/> for it is not possible to take any step that would<lb/> not involve a very disagreeable newspaper controversy<lb/> and wd. probably do more harm than good</p>
