                        <p>George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising.</p>
                    
                        <p>Gavan Duffy had been acting for Ernest Blythe (1889-1975), organiser for the Irish Volunteers. Blythe had been arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act. He was released from prison in England before the Easter Rising but was rearrested there during Easter week 1916.</p>
                    
                        <p>Gavan Duffy writes after Blythe had been released from prison and asks Blythe to send him a copy of the local paper if it includes a report of his court case.</p>
