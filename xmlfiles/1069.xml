                        <p>This is a letter from politician and Dublin MP Alfred &#39;Alfie&#39; Byrne (1882-1956) to Helena Malony (1883-1967), republican, feminist and labour activist, and Helen &#39;Nellie&#39; Gifford (1880-1971), republican activist. Byrne was first elected an MP in the 1915 by-election as a nationalist candidate for the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although opposed to the Easter Rising, he spent 1916 lobbying on behalf of the interned prisoners. Before the Rising he was also a vociferous anti-conscription campaigner. Malony was a founder member of Inghinide na hEireann, a member of the Irish Citizen Army and a close colleague of James Connolly and Countess Markievicz. She was part of the garrison of rebels who seized City Hall during the Easter Rising and was imprisoned in Aylesbury prison until December 1916. Nellie Gifford was an active opponent of conscription in Ireland. She was a member of the Irish Citizen Army and part of the St Stephen&#39;s Green garrison during the Easter Rising. Two of her sisters were married to executed leaders of the Rising.</p>
                    
                        <p>This letter refers to fears that Irishmen residing in Britain would be conscripted into the British army (conscription was introduced in Britain but never in Ireland). Byrne outlines plans to oppose this.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Molony</salute>

<p>I have been making inquiries<lb/>
about the position of Irishmen<lb/>
in Great Britain and I am <lb/>
informed the best way to safe guard<lb/> 
them is to oppose the conscription <lb/>
bill on the  whole should we fail <lb/>
to defeat it.  I will then put <lb/>
down an amendment to exempt <lb/>
all Irishmen no matter where they <pb/>
           
                <pb n="2768" facs="a1ce327f35f35e8f7315d783d6068ba7.jpg"/>
                reside.  This you can rest assured<lb/> 
I will do </p>

<salute>Yours faithfully</salute>
Alfred Byrne
