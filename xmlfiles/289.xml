                        <p>This letter was written by Eileen Corrigan (d. 1993) to her mother. Eileen had arrived in Dublin on 24 April 1916, the first day of the Easter Rising, from Belfast to sit her exams in the Trinity College and wrote this note to her mother in order to let her know that communication for Dublin had stopped but that she had arrived safely. </p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>Eileen Corrigan was one of just four female students who sat their exams as rebellion and counter attack swirled about outside Trinity’s walls. They were rewarded with lunch in Provost Mahafy’s house hosted by his wife, Frances Letitia.</p>

<p>Just a line to let you know<lb/> I arrived safely, in case the<lb/> papers should make you<lb/> anxious. All communication<lb/> is stopped from Dublin<lb/> but a lady promised to<lb/> post this tomorrow from the North. Everything will<lb/> probably be all right<lb/> tomorrow, as the military<lb/> are coming from Curragh.</p>
