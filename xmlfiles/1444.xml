                        <p>This letter was written by Sir Hubert de la Poer Gough (1870 - 1963). Gough was a senior officer in the British Army in the First World War. In 1916 he was promoted to lead the Reserve Army, renamed the ‘Fifth Army’, from the Somme offensive to the retreat of March 1918.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>The letter was addressed to Augustine Birrell (1850 - 1933). Birrell was the chief secretary for Ireland from 1907 until his retirement in 1916 following the aftermath of the Easter Rising.</p>
                    
                        <p></p>
                    
                        <p>This letter is an inquiry into what is happening in areas around Galway. As there are no ports, telegraphs or railways are open, Gough fears that &#39;regrettable events are occurring&#39;. </p>
                    
                        <p>A note on the letter indicates that the letter was received by the General Secretary&#39;s Office quite late (10 May),  and is therefore not being answered as it is presumed the county is now quiet.</p>
