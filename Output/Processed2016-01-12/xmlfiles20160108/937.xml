                            <p>A letter from Kathleen Hogan to Nancy O'Rahilly (1875-1961). Kathleen writes to congratulate Mrs. O'Rahilly on the birth of her son and asks for a postcard letting her know how she is. Finally he congratulates 'little Michael Joseph' and hopes he will take his great father's place for his mother and for Ireland.</p>
                        
                            <p>Nancy O'Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly (1875-1916). The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death â€“ the child was born three months later. </p>

3 Bayview, Bettystown. July 31st My dear Madam O'Rahilly, Just a line to congratulate you on the birth of your little son, for whom I can wish nothing better than to be a worthy son of his dear father. I was hoping for a little girl for you, but I am quite sure you are satisfied with God's gift, and no doubt it must be for the best. How are you yourself? I hope you got over your illness well, and that you are as strong as usual. I should like very much to have word of you, if Mal? could be persuaded to send me a postcard. I know boys hate writing, but he might get through half a dozen words on a p.c. I ask no more. With all good wishes for you and Baby, and affectionate regards, dear Madam O'Rahilly, Your sincere friend Kathleen Hogan.
