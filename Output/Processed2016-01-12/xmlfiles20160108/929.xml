                            <p>This letter is from Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947), to C.T. Munro (1869-1952), the governor of Mountjoy prison. Mabel had written a letter to her husband in Mountjoy but he was transferred to Dartmoor before it arrived. She is concerned that the letter, when forwarded from Mountjoy to Dartmoor, will be counted as her husband's allowance of one letter on arrival in Dartmoor. She asks the governor to intervene as she fears that, under the rules, she will have to wait four months for further communication.</p>
                        
                            <p>Mabel Fitzgerald was the wife of Irish Volunteer Desmond Fitzgerald.  Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week. Charles Arthur Munro (1869-1952) was the governor of Mountjoy prison in Dublin. He is also the brother of the noted author H.H. Munro, better known through his literary pseudonym, Saki.</p>

2 Loretto Villas, Bray 2nd June,1910 The Governor, Mountjoy Prison, Dublin  Sir, I find that my husband Mr Desmond Fitzgerald, left Mountjoy Prison, on Friday last so that he could not have received my 1 letter before his departure. I had been told at the Prison that he would be able to write me and to receive one letter within the first week. I waited to write him till I should have had his letter which came on Friday morning: I posted my reply on Friday afternoon. I have just heard from him again from Dartmoor : it appears they are permitted to write once and receive a letter after arrival there. I think it very likely that my letter to my husband was forwarded on from Mountjoy in which case he fears that it may count as the letter he has the right to receive in Dartmoor. I shall be very much obliged if you will write the Governor of Dartmoor explaining  matters so that he may be given the letter which I am now writing him to Dartmoor. As <del>deleted text</del> he will not have another letter for four months I am anxious that he should not lose this on through a mistake. I am, Yours truly

<addrLine>Mountjoy Prison,</addrLine>
<addrLine>Dublin</addrLine></address>  <salute>Sir,</salute></opener> <p>I find that my husband Mr Desmond Fitzgerald, left Mount <lb/>joy Prison, on Friday last so that he could not have received my 1  <lb/>letter before his departure. I had been told at the Prison that he  <lb/>would be able to write me and to receive one letter within the  <lb/>first week. I waited to write him till I should have had his letter  <lb/>which came on Friday morning: I posted my reply on Friday after <lb/>noon.</p> <p>I have just heard from him again from Dartmoor : it  <lb/>appears they are permitted to write once and receive a letter  <lb/>after arrival there.</p> <p>I think it very likely that my letter to my husband  <lb/>was forwarded on from Mountjoy in which case he fears that it  <lb/>may count as the letter he has the right to receive in Dartmoor.  <lb/>I shall be very much obliged if you will write the Governor of Dart <lb/>moor explaining  matters so that he may be given the letter which  <lb/>I am now writing him to Dartmoor. As <del>the</del> he will not have another  <lb/>letter for four months I am anxious that he should not lose this  <lb/>one through a mistake.</p> <closer><salute>I am, Yours truly</salute></closer>
