                            <p>A letter from Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington (1877-1946) to John Dillon (1851-1927) . Sheehy-Skeffington wonders if the report of the inquiry will be a 'white-washing' exercise but says that either way it is valuable 'for its strictures on Martial Law' but the real culprits, the military authorities in Dublin Castle will not be blamed. She reports that none of the property taken in raids on her home has been returned. She also outlines what appears to be harassment of her landlady, Mrs. Schmutz while Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington was away on holiday. Detectives had called on a number of occasions demanding information as to Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington's whereabouts and threatening the landlady with penalties. She also reports an incident with detectives which arose when her mother was being removed by ambulance.  She asks Mr.Dillon to make representations on her behalf so that these activities can be curtailed and wants to know if the Government wishes her to report as an 'alien' (one of the detectives is based in the Aliens Department).</p>
                        
                            <p>Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, suffragette, nationalist, language teacher, was the widow of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington (who was summarily executed on 26 April 1916). She was active during the Rising, bringing food to the Volunteers in the G.P.O. and the College of Surgeons. Four days passed before she found out what had happened to her husband, Francis (1878-1916), and it wasn't until almost two weeks later that the full details of his execution emerged.</p>
                        
                            <p>John Dillon was an Irish Party M.P. in the House of Commons. In a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down “with so much blood and so much savagery”, and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Mrs.Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to the incident and raids on her home.  </p>

It was anticipated it seems to me largely a white washing report, still such as it is it is valuable for its        on martial land. It does not however? fasten the blame on the real culprits, the         authorities in Dublin Castle.  So far, although we have re-
