                            <p>This letter from Sister Cyprian to Éamon de Valera (1882-1975) was enclosed in a letter dated 29 May 1916 addressed to Sinéad de Valera (1878-1975), his wife,  together with a pair of scapulars and a request that they be forwarded to Mr de Valera in prison. Sr.Cyprian sympathises with his situation and reassures him of her prayers - she invites him to join her in prayer daily at 7.00 a.m.,  and she asks him to urge his wife to bring his children to her for a visit.</p>
                        
                            <p>Éamonn De Valera had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and was adjutant to Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), Dublin Brigade commandant. He went on to command forces at Bolands Mill during the Rising and was the most senior participant to escape execution. De Valera would go on to become one of the most influential figures in Ireland's 20th century.</p>

Mercy Convent Cork Street Dublin 30 - V 1916.  My dear Mr. De Valera, <p>It is no small draught of consolation that you possess the gift of <lb/>life - a gift which has become more precious than ever to those who sympathize with<lb/>you in your loneliness &amp; who love you.</p> <p>Most men of great genius have to go through in life<lb/>a period of retirement &amp; solitude, brought about by choice or by Divine Providence through<lb/>the medium of human beings.  The <hi rend="underline">Poet</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="underline">Saint</hi> have to pass this way.  Saintship<sic>unusually-spelled text</sic> is<lb/> only a special type of genius.  Now your time is come &amp; you will come out of it as<lb/> the sunshine from underneath the cloud.  A cheerful acceptation<sic>unusually-spelled text</sic> of the surroundings &amp;<lb/>the observance of rule, will go far to the shortening of your stay there.  The beginning will be<lb/>the hardest : as those in charge get to know you they will appreciate you.</p> <p>Since 1st May I have prayed every day very specially<lb/>for you that you may get grace to bear this cross &amp; be released soon.  I shall begin<lb/>this '9 First Fridays' for you on 2nd June.  If our religion be true &#x2014; and we <hi rend="underline">know</hi><hi rend="underline">it</hi> <hi rend="underline">is</hi> <hi rend="underline">true</hi> <hi rend="underline">God</hi> is <hi rend="underline">with us</hi> &amp; since He is with us, we can be in spirit with one another: now I want<lb/>you to keep a little appointment with me each day at 7 o'clock a.m. when we have Mass<lb/>&amp;Holy Communion &amp;at 6.30 p.m. when I shall say each day The 30 days prayer<lb/> to our Blessed Lady for you.  I am only asking you to try &amp;remember that you<lb/>are remembered then.  Prayer can obtain all things &#x2014; hope &amp; when God acts He doeth the work as God.  <p> <p>"This gloom after all<lb/>is but the shade of Gods hand outstretched caressingly"<pb/></p>

I am only asking you to try &amp;remember that you <lb/>are remembered then.

The <hi rend="underline">Poet</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="underline">Saint</hi> have to pass this way.  <sic>Saintship</sic> is <lb/> only a special type of genius.  Now your time is come &amp; you will come out of it as <lb/> the sunshine from underneath the cloud.  A cheerful <sic>acceptation</sic> of the surroundings &amp; <lb/>the observance of rule, will go far to the shortening of your stay there.  The beginning will be<lb/>the hardest -: as those in charge get to know you they will appreciate you.</p> <p>Since 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> May I have prayed every day very specially <lb/> for you that you may get grace to bear this cross &amp; be released soon.
