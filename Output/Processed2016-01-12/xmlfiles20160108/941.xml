                            <p>This letter is from M.B. MacDonough to Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). The writer's husband is being transferred from Wandsworth Prison to Wales and she acknowledges a letter from her husband which Mrs. FitzGerald had relayed to her. She sympathises with Mrs FitzGerald on her husband's 10 year sentence and hopes for a free Ireland soon when all can be reunited with their loved ones.</p>
                        
                            <p>Mabel Fitzgerald was the wife of Irish Volunteer Desmond Fitzgerald.  Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>
