                            <p>A letter from Niaffe de Buitléir to Nancy O'Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer expresses sympathy on the death of The O'Rahilly (1875-1916) who led 'a noble life' and had 'a splendid death', having made the 'supreme sacrifice' despite his beloved wife and children. She writes that the oldest O'Rahilly boy, Risteárd, is now The O'Rahilly.  De Buitléir assures Nancy that her husband lives on in the hearts of the people of his country.</p>
                        
                            <p>Niaffe de Buitléir signs herself as Bean Thomáis Uí Nialláin. Tomas Ó Nualláin fought in the Four Courts Garrison during the 1916 Rising. Nancy O'Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly. The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death – the child was born three months later. </p>

Since <lb/> I heard the terrible news  <lb/>you &amp; he have been constantly <lb/> in my thoughts and prayers. <lb/> I keep picturing you in <lb/> anguish, but strange to <lb/> say I cannot think of him <lb/> in pain or suffering.

            <lb/>and there is a look of glad triumph <lb/> in his eyes. I feel sure he is  <lb/>already in Heaven. He lived <lb/> a noble life and died a splen <lb/>-did death. Coming almost  <lb/>straight from the altar with <lb/> his Eucharistic Lord in his <lb/> heart he laid down his  <lb/>gallant life for his brethren. <lb/>Staring the danger into which <lb/>he had not led them, making <lb/>his supreme sacrifice for <lb/>the cause he served, though <lb/>he would have <unclear>chosen</unclear> a  <lb/>different way of serving it <lb/>if the choice had been left to him. <lb/>With a beloved wife and children, <lb/><unclear>and a very</unclear> happy home, every <lb/>-thing to make life sweet, he  <lb/>sacrificed all at the bidding of what <lb/>he believed to be his call.</p>

            <p>Duty and honour and the country for  <lb/> which he died will never forget this. His   <lb/> name will be held in love and veneration  <lb/> forever. The day may come when  <lb/> this thought may bring some solace  <lb/> to your stricken soul. Now I feel that  <lb/> you can feel nothing but anguish and  <lb/> Isolation. May God comfort you  <lb/> He alone can, and may your children  <lb/> grow up to be your pride and joy., <lb/> those already around you and the little  <lb/> one who is coming. God bless you &amp; them
