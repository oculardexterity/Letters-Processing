                            <p>A Letter from Robert Lynch to Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). The writer expresses sorrow at the 'horrible sentence' imposed on her husband. He admires the way that Desmond FitzGerald and The O'Rahilly, (1875-1916), 'went in' (to the GPO) having initially tried to stop the Rising.  The writer promises to make representations on Mr FitzGerald's behalf and expresses that an amnesty will see him free when Home Rule is established. He writes that the English were unwise to carryout the executions as the only served to dignify the insurgents. He regrets the loss of his friend, John MacDermott (Seán MacDiarmada, 1883-1916, executed on 12 May 1916) but the bitterest losses were James Connolly (1868-1916, executed 12 May 1916), and Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878-1916). The writer criticises Patrick Pearse (1879-1916, one of the Rising leaders, also executed on 3 May 1916) for his "bloodshed gospel", which he describes as 'a wild delusion.'</p>
                        
                            <p>Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

You probably guess what I thought of  <lb/>Pearse &amp; the leaders, but the way Fitz &amp; the O'Rahilly  <lb/>went in after trying to stop the affair was the sort of  <lb/>heroic thing to which we all have to take off our hats.  <lb/>I'll certainly get the facts of Fitz's behaviour &amp; of his  <lb/>non-combatancy put before any people of influence I  <lb/>can get at. He <del>cautiously</del>ought to be treated as a  <lb/>political prisoner at once, &amp; an amnesty is certain,  <lb/>I should say, within a very short time of a  <lb/>Home Rule Parliament's coming into existence. I feel  <lb/>exactly as you do about the executions. The English,  <lb/>I think, were mad to permit them from their own  <lb/>point-of-view. They seem to me to have given the  <lb/>movement a <unclear>national</unclear> dignity it would not have  <lb/>had if Asquith or Maxwell or Redmond or any- <lb/>body had been as wise as Botha.
