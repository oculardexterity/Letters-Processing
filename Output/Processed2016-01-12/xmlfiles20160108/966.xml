                            <p>The letter was written on behalf of the chief commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, Walter Edgeworth-Johnstone (1863-1937), and is in response to complaints from Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington  (1877-1946) about visits by detectives to she and her landlady. The reply confirms that she is not required to complete items 10, 11, and 12 and denies that the landlady was told otherwise. The visits were because of breaches of Aliens Regulations by Mrs.Schmutz. The writer denies that any enquiries were made as to Hanna Sheehy Skeffington's whereabouts and notes that the detective (Sgt. Ahern) was calling to see her about missing property.</p>
                        
                            <p>Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, suffragette, nationalist, language teacher, was the widow of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington (who was summarily executed on 26 April 1916). She was active during the Rising, bringing food to the Volunteers in the G.P.O. and the College of Surgeons. Four days passed before she found out what had happened to her husband and it wasn't until almost two weeks later that the full detail emerged.</p>
