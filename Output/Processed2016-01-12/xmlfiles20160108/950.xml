                            <p>A letter from Sister Mangan to Nancy O'Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer is a cousin of The O'Rahilly (1875-1916) and offers deep sympathy on his death to the O'Rahilly family, and also to his sisters, Nell and Anna. The writer understands that Michael didn't die immediately and she hopes that Mrs. O'Rahilly and he had some time together to share his last moments. Prayers and Mass have been offered.</p>
                        
                            <p>Nancy O'Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly. The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death â€“ the child was born three months later. </p>

my feelings of condolence under the weight of this heavy cross: I will ask Our Lord to console and comfort you all in this hour of trial. he knows what is best for us all and perhaps much good may arise where now we cannot see anything but sadness & trials. I would have written when I first saw the sad announcement in the papers but enquired first from Father Dominic if such were really true, only today I heard the funeral took place on friday last & that Michael had a happy death. I conclude from this he didn't die immediately, & I trust you had the consolation of relieving his last moments by every kind attention & that he was fully conscious. Rev. Mothers had a general Communion offered by all here for the happy repose of his soul and Father Con offered Mass on Friday foe same intention. R.I.P. Con is giving a retreat at present in Belfast & he too is deeply grieved at this sore trial. All the Sisters are praying for dear Michael & greatly sympathise

with you. How are you all feeling dear Nan? I hope not fretting too much, he died for his country & nobly did it. We must hope he may soon enjoy the everlasting bliss of heaven, where you and he will be again united for ever. Get many Masses offered for his soul, & tell Nell & Anna to do likewise.

I hear they are great Irish speakers.
