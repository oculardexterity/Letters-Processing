                            <p>Letter to Nancy O'Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer, Celia, expresses sympathy on Michael's (1875-1916) death and wishes she could be there to comfort Mr. O'Rahilly - 'he died as he wished fighting for his country'.</p>
                        
                            <p>Nancy O'Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly. The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death â€“ the child was born three months later. </p>

My dearest Nannie, I can't write how heartbroken we are about poor Michael. I nearly go crazy when I think of your awful sorrow.

<opener><salute>My dearest Nannie</salute></opener>, <p>I can't write  <lb/>how heartbroken we are about <lb/> poor Michael. I nearly go <lb/> crazy when I think of your <lb/> awful sorrow. I am doing <lb/> my utmost to get over <lb/> to you, not that having me <lb/> would lessen your sorrow <lb/> but I should like to be  <lb/>with you. Uncle is going <lb/> to try and give me the <lb/> money if this deal goes <lb/> through. He feels simply <lb/> terrible about Michael, in <lb/> fact I can't tell you <lb/> how miserable we all are

            <lb/>All we can do at present <lb/> is to pray for you both.  <lb/>He certainly died as he wished <lb/> fighting for his country, but <lb/> how hard for those he left <lb/> behind. Nannie dear when <lb/> you feel able let us know <lb/> how you are, we are so  <lb/>worried. When do you expect <lb/> your baby? If I only could <lb/> be with you when you do. <lb/>My dear girl, I know you  <lb/>understand how simply awful <lb/> I feel, how futile words are <lb/> to express our sorrow. All I  <lb/>hope is to be with you soon<lb/>. <lb/>All our love and sympathy</p> <closer><salute>Lovingly</salute> <signed>Celia</signed></closer>
