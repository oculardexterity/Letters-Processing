                            <p>This letter is from Ernest Blythe (1889-1975), to Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947).Blythe writes from Brixton Prison. He was surprised to hear that Desmond FitzGerald had been imprisoned but he believes he will not have to serve for long. He hasn't heard anything of his friends since he was arrested and for approximately a fortnight he hadn't been getting newspapers so he doesn't know what friends may have been killed or imprisoned in that time.</p>
                        
                            <p>Earnest Blythe was an organiser for the Irish Volunteers. He had been arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act. He was released from prison in England before the Easter Rising but was rearrested there during Easter week 1916. Mabel Fitzgerald was the wife of Irish Volunteer Desmond Fitzgerald. Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

I thought you must have <lb/> moved from Bray and <lb/> I didn't know what <lb/> address would find <lb/> anybody or who had <lb/> been left at large that <lb/> I could write to. I <lb/> wrote to Helen but a letter

            <lb/>apparently takes more than <lb/> a fortnight in going and <lb/> coming; so I have had no <lb/> news of any of my friends  <lb/>since the postcard I got <lb/> from Jack a few days <lb/> after I was arrested. I  <lb/>was surprised when I  <lb/>read about Desmond because  <lb/>Jack said he was all right <lb/>. Seven-and-a-half years would <lb/> be a devilish long time if  <lb/>he had to serve it all; <lb/> but I don't suppose there's <lb/> any question of that.</p> <p>I was informed a couple of

            <lb/>days ago that Kate had <lb/> written asking if she could <lb/> visit me, so I shall expect she'll <lb/> be round here on Saturday <lb/>. I should have written <lb/> to her but I had not <lb/> her address. I was in the <lb/> same plight in regard to  <lb/>Arthur who was down to <lb/> see me the day before I  <lb/>was arrested.</p> <p>Someone has been sending <lb/> in my dinner since Sunday. <lb/> I have money on hands but <lb/> I took the prison food <lb/> because I knew I should have

            <lb/>to revert to it in a few weeks <lb/> and might then want the <lb/> money for something else. In <lb/> any case, you will remember <lb/> that it suits me and I  <lb/>thrive upon it so I suffer no hardship. <lb/>I got the "Weekly Irish Times" I  <lb/>suppose from you a couple of days <lb/> ago. <del>It</del>I was glad to have it <lb/> for there were several items of <lb/> news in it that I had not <lb/> seen before. I have been getting the <lb/> "Independent" fairly regularly <lb/> from Helen since Desmond's <lb/> sentence was announced. I also <lb/> get "The Times" every day. Before <lb/> that, however, I was nearly  <lb/>a fortnight without papers. So that <lb/> a lot of people I knew may have <lb/> been killed or imprisoned without my <lb/> knowing.</p> <closer><salute>Yours</salute> <signed>Ernest Blythe</signed> <address><addrLine>Mrs.Fitzgerald, Bray</addrLine></address></closer>
