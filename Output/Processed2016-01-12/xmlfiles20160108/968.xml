                            <p>A letter written by Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington (1877-1946) to John Dillon (1851-1927). Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington wants Dillon to press for publication of the evidence. She says that about a third of the property uplifted in the raids on her home by Bowen-Colthurst’s men has been returned and she lists, as best she can, what is still missing. Her solicitor has put in a claim for compensation and there has been a payment which was less than the claim. She comments that all of this is trivial compared with ‘the bigger question’ and asks when the report is likely to be debated (in the House).</p>
                        
                            <p>Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, suffragette, nationalist, language teacher, was the widow of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington (who was summarily executed on 26 April 1916). She was active during the Rising, bringing food to the Volunteers in the G.P.O. and the College of Surgeons. Four days passed before she found out what had happened to her husband and it wasn't until almost two weeks later that the full detail emerged.</p>
                        
                            <p> John Dillon was an Irish Party M.P. in the House of Commons. Dillon issued a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down “with so much blood and so much savagery”, and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Mrs. Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to the incident and raids on her home.</p>

in terms of money: the sum was £49 odd. I received last week order for £44 - I suppose the assessor feels it his duty not to award the full sum. Mine was a perfectly honest estimate + was, if anything, un^derstated. Quantities of private letters of my own letters from my husband to me before our marriage, manuscripts of his, including articles for press, poems and an unfinished play on which he had been working for a couple of years) + various other documents of literary value, several educational books (scraps, pictures, etc) of my own, necessary for my work + now difficult to replace owing to war conditions, have not been restored, as well as many private relics + souvenirs of <hi rend="underline">my husband which were very precious to me</hi> <del> have never been returned</del>: on such things, no money value can be put + it would mean a great deal to me if they could be traced and restored. <hi rend="underline">Lieutenant Morris testified in his evidence at inquiry that Capt.
