                            <p>This is a letter from Michael Citroen (b.1892), a British seed and plant merchant, to Herbert Samuel (1870-1963), the Home Secretary for England. The letter is an application for compensation by Michael Citroen. In the letter he states that he went to Dublin to attend the Spring Show, sending his last £50 to get there in hope of receiving a profit, however due to the Easter Rising he could not attend and lost his money. He goes on to state that this has effectively ruined him. Citroen goes on to ask for a government position if he cannot be compensated. </p>

May 12th 1916. The Home Secretary Whitehall, S.W. Dear Sir, I am given to understand that some compensation will be given to sufferers of the Irish rebellion. I beg to inform you that I went to the Dublin Spring Show with three assistants, but on account of the unfortunate circumstances, we could not reach the Show. This affair cost me nearly £50. I would not mind this loss so much, but that it was the last few pounds I had in the world. I have been attending this show for some years & always made a considerable profit. I might mention that through prevailing circumstances my business as above has been practically ruined, I suffered considerable loss the first & second year, & now I am left with nothing. If nothing can be done for me in this matter, may I ask you, if something could be found for me in some Government office. I am above the Military age, & have had considerable experience. Trusting to receive an early & favourable reply. I am, Your obedient Servant Michael Citroen <note>Ackn.<gap/>& say that no measures are in contemplatio wh. wd. meet the case he adduces RC 16/5/16</note> <note>done SP 17/5</note>

I beg to inform you that I went to the Dublin<lb/>  Spring Show with three assistants, but on account of the<lb/>  unfortunate circumstances, we could not reach the Show.<lb/>  This affair cost me nearly £50. I would not mind this<lb/>  loss so much, but that it was the last few pounds<lb/>  I had in the world. I have been attending this show<lb/>  for some years &amp; always made a considerable profit.<lb/> I might mention that through prevailing circumstances<lb/>  my business as above has been practically ruined, I suffered<lb/>  considerable loss the first &amp; second year, &amp; now I am left with<lb/>  nothing.</p> <p>If nothing can be done for me in this matter, <lb/> may I ask you, if something could be found for me<lb/>  in some Government office. I am above the Military<lb/>  age, &amp; have had considerable experience.<lb/> Trusting to receive an early &amp; favourable reply.</p> <closer><salute>I am,<lb/> Your obedient Servant</salute></closer> Michael Citroen<lb/> <note>Ackn.2 &amp; say<lb/>  that no measures are in<lb/>  contemplation wh. wd. meet the<lb/>  case he adduces RC 16/5/16</note>
