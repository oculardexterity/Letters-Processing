                            <p>Maeve Cavanagh (d. 1960) was proclaimed the &#39;poetess of the revolution&#39; by James Connolly and sister of cartoonist Ernest Cavanagh who was shot dead on steps of Liberty Hall, a civilian casualty during the Easter Rising. This letter, sent to British Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), accompanies a petition requesting a reprieve of the death sentence of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) in which she points out the wide variety of respectable people who have signed it and mentions many more who are to follow. Casement had been arrested on Banna Strand, County Kerry, on the eve of the Easter Rising and sentenced to death for treason. He was hanged on 3 August 1916.</p>
