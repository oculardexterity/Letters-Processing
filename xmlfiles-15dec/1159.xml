                            <p>This letter is from a collection Patrick English (1894-1970), who at the time of writing was a prisoner in Stafford prison and Frongoch internment camp.  While this letter is undated, it is clear from the context that the letter was written not long after the Rising.  In the letter, Davie tells his brother that he is not to worry about their mother, although she is very lonely.      Davie writes about the lack of sport and enquires after other people he knows that are in Frongoch with his brother.  He also mentions how sad he feels about the events of the Rising and how he hopes that peace will come soon. He ends the letter with a postscript that Patrick will have to find another girlfriend when he gets home as his one is now &#34;stepping out&#34; with a soldier.    Patrick English was an Irish Volunteer imprisoned in the Stafford and later Frongoch Prisons. He had at least six cousins fighting with the British Army in France during his incarceration.</p>
