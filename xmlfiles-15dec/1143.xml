                            <p>In this letter George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) writes that he cannot represent Earnest Blythe (1889-1975) this time as he is busy with Roger Casement&#39;s defence. Instead he will send a colleague to see him in Brixton. He advises him not to be too hopeful of success because of the attitudes of the British authorities and public towards Sinn FÃ©in and the rebellion.    George Gavan Duffy was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising.    Gavan Duffy had been acting for Ernest Blythe, organiser for the Irish Volunteers. Blythe had been arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act. He was released from prison in England before the Easter Rising but was rearrested there during Easter week 1916.  </p>
