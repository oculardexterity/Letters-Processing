                            <p>This is a letter from Richard Thomas Pomeroy (1858-1937), member of the Petty Sessions Office on Mill Street District Cork, to Robert Chalmers (1858-1938), the under-secretary to Ireland. Robert Chalmers assumed the role in 1916 for a brief period following the resignation of Matthew Nathan (1862-1939), after accepting political failure during the 1916 Easter Rising. The letter claims to transmit a resolution made by the magistrates of the Mill Street petty session district on 17 May 1916. The resolution regards the events of the Easter Rising, stating that the board has resolved to suggest to the government that the Peace Preservation Act should be enforced, along with more policing. Pomeroy names man who attended the meeting, including James J. Hickey (b.1876) and Joseph Alexander Harty (b.1862).</p>
