                            <p>This is a letter from Eamonn O&#39;Modhráin (Edward Moran) (d. 1955) to his mother, Mary Moran. O&#39;Modhráin had been arrested after the Easter Rising and imprisoned, spending time in Wakefield Prison and Frongach Internment Camp. This letter was sent while O&#39;Modhráin was in Frongach. In the letter he refers to conditions and activities in the prison, a planned visit by his sisters and requests clothes and books. He also refers to matters relating to the family farm in County Kildare noting that his brother Lewis, who had been released from Wakefield, &#39;can charge current prices for materials&#39;.</p>

<address>290. Ed. Moran, Irish Prisoner of War<lb/> South Camp, Frongoch, N. Wales. <opener><dateline><date>3 V11. 16</date></dateline> <salute>My Dearest Mother</salute></opener> <p>Your letter &amp; Norman's came<lb/>  Sat. and Maire's yesterday. I was very glad<lb/>  to get them and to learn that all are well. Let you<lb/>  all write often. We have Mass, confession &amp; Holy<lb/>  Comm. every Sunday. Don't send papers, "Ind" comes<lb/>  every day now, send some books, Irish &amp; English.<lb/> As weather is wet I will want a coat &amp; vest, rough<lb/>  tweed, good clothes no use here, they will want to be<lb/>  larger than last measurement, also putties like<lb/>  Knickers and a portmanteau, not too big, suit case<pb/>

            would do. I hope visiting time will be extended before<lb/>  Tess &amp; Una come and that Maire can arrange to<lb/>  come also. Glad to know all well Enniscorthy<lb/> Would you ask Maire to spend some of her holidays<lb/>  with you. better buy cake now for delivery in<lb/>  Nov., Cotton or Linseed, whichever better no<lb/>t 2½ or 3 tons. I charged Casey 30/= for ten acres,<lb/>  his own stuff. Let Lewie charge current prices<lb/>  for materials. We are not having a bad time here<lb/>  lectures, concerts, Irish classes, football, physical<lb/>  drill, we had a march into country to-day. With<lb/>  best love to all, particularly the children.</p>  Éamonn.
