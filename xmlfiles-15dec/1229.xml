<opener><address><addrLine>Honan Hostel</addrLine>
<addrLine>Cork</addrLine></address> <dateline><date> 25 May 1916 </date></dateline> <salute>Dear Nell</salute></opener> <p> I would have written to you long ago<lb/>  or at least to Anna, but I did not like intruding on you and besides I <lb/> presume all letters to you + her are carefully perused by English spies. <p> <p> I will say nothing about Michael. He was a hero &amp; is respected<lb/>  &amp; honoured even by his enemies. This is not the time for speaking.<lb/>  But his blood will not have been shed in vain. We are all Irish <lb/> now! I am going to try to be an Irishman in future. </p> <p> I am glad that you are feeling none the worse after your <lb/> ill-treatment. I hope Dick will keep strong until he gets out. <p> <p> You understand that we cant do or say much these times. <lb/> Please accept my sincerest sympathy. Could we wish for a<lb/>  noble &amp; better death for anyone?</p> <p>I hope Anna &amp; others will be able to collect evidence<lb/>  concerning the Hun's atrocities. Even though it cannot be<lb/>  published now, a day is coming. </p> <p>Love to Anna &amp; yourself </p>  <closer><salute>Yours affectionately</salute></closer> Alfred Rahilly<lb/> <note>Don't bother answering this</note>
