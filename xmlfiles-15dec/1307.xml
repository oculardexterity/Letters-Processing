                            <p>This is a letter from Edward O&#39;Farrell (1857-1926), the assistant under-secretary for Ireland, to the major-general in charge of administration. The letter was written a month following the 1916 Easter Rising. It regards a state of martial law that is now enforced, stating that the commander in chief of the Irish forces, General Sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859-1929), has called for such action. The letter goes on to state that 100 copies will be supplied the recipient of the letter.    Sir John Maxwell briefly held command of British troops in Egypt, where he successfully organised defences against a Turkish attack in February 1915 and presided over the huge expansion of his command as Egypt became a major British imperial military base. In March 1916, having been superseded as general officer commanding in Egypt, he was recalled home when the Easter Rising broke out.</p>
