                            <p>Paddy Holahan was interned in Frongoch following his involvement in the fighting in the Four Courts area. He writes this letter to Fr Albert, a Capuchin priest based in Church Street. Holahan describes the difficulty in receiving &#39;the Sacraments&#39; in Frongoch prison as they have only one priest. Holahan also mentions Fr Albert&#39;s presence at Se√°n Heuston&#39;s (1891-1916) execution, writing that it is &#39;delightful to see our leaders converted to the Catholic faith.&#39;    The Capuchin priests were very involved with na Fianna Eireann and Irish Volunteers before, during and after 1916. They cared for the wounded and administered the last rights to the leaders of the Rising in Kilmainham jail during Easter Week. </p>

Sunday and then we have to wait till the following Sunday.  will you please call on my mother and see that she is alright as I got a letter saying that she was sick and you know that the brother and I are her only support.  I was glad to hear that you were with Heuston and when he died as I was very fond of him.  It is <sic>delightfull</sic> to see all our leaders being covered to the catholic faith.
