                            <p>  This is a letter from Cis M. Coyle to James Ryan (1891-1970), 3 June 1916. It was written while Ryan was a prisoner in Stafford. The writer refers to people at home who are asking for Ryan, two of his fellow prisoners and requests that Ryan let her know if he would like anything sent to him.    James Ryan studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna FÃ¡il and a government minister.</p>
