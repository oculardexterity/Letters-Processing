                            <p>This is a copy of letter from Michael Fogarty (1859-1955), bishop of Killaloe, to Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929), Irish historian and nationalist. Stopford Green was a close friend of Sir Roger Casement (1865-1916) and one those involved in the campaign to reprieve Casement&#39;s sentenced to death for treason after he had been arrested on Banna Strand in County Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising.  Fogarty writes to enclose a petition on behalf of Casement and writes in strong support of Casement, noting that no public interest would be served by Casement&#39;s execution. The letters also notes that the signatures of a number of other clergy will follow. Fogarty was said to have been opposed to the Easter Rising but later wrote against the partition of Ireland and of &#39;hideous atrocities&#39; committed by the British on Irish nationalists.</p>
