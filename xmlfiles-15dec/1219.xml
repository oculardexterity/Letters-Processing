                            <p>This letter was written by Bridie O&#39;Rahilly (d. 1971) to Anna O&#39;Rahilly (d. 1958). In the letter Bridie offers Anna sympathy on the death of her brother Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). Bridie writes that the people in her area seem to be proud that Michael came from their village, Ballylongford (County Kerry) and that Michael&#39;s sister, Nell, had been released from prison.    Michael Joseph &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875â€“1916) was a nationalist and a journalist. In 1916 he aligned himself with Eoin MacNeill and Bulmer Hobson who opposed a preemptive rising. Although O&#39;Rahilly played a large role in delivering MacNeill&#39;s countermanding order he felt obligated to stand with the men he recruited and trained. O&#39;Rahilly was fatally wounded on the Thursday 27 April when the GPO was being evacuated.   </p>

Bank of Ireland Office, Listowel 25th May 1916. <del>All Letters to be addressed to the Agent</del>  My dear Anna, It is time for me to write to you, but it is not from want of thought that I have deferred writing until now. I have scarcely ceased thinking of you all since I heard the terribly sad news about poor Michael; and I have prayed fervently for him and for you all every day since. This was the only small way in which I could assist you. Sometimes I wonder how the rest of you managed to survive these past few weeks at all. But with the Cross God gives the needful grace, I suppose. It would have only added to your grief, if possible, could you have seen how the country people round here took poor Michael's death. Except I had been on the spot I could not have credited it. They seemed to have been very proud that this was his native district; and I know that he will have a most impressive funeral when he is brought down to the Abbey. R.I.P. I am very glad, indeed, that Nell is released again. I hope she

I have <lb/> scarcely ceased thinking of you all  <lb/>since I heard the terribly sad news  <lb/>about poor Michael; and I have prayed  <lb/>fervently for him and for you all every day  <lb/>since. This was the only small way in  <lb/>which I could assist you. Sometimes I  <lb/>wonder how the rest of you managed <lb/> to survive these past few weeks at all.  <lb/>But with the Cross God gives the  <lb/>needful grace, I suppose.</p> <p>It would have only added to <lb/>your grief, if possible, could you have <lb/> seen how the country people round <lb/> here took poor Michael's death. Except I <lb/> had been on the spot I could not have <lb/>credited it. They seemed to have been <lb/> very proud that this was his native  <lb/>district; and I know that he will <lb/>have a most impressive funeral when  <lb/>he is brought down to the Abbey. R.I.P.</p> <p>I am very glad, indeed, that  <lb/>Nell is released again. I hope she

            <lb/>is not feeling very done up after the  <lb/>prison treatment. Or perhaps the  <lb/>women are treated somewhat better. <lb/>Mother told me, too, that you have  <lb/>heard Dick is well. D.G. If he were <lb/> in Dublin even it would be a relief <lb/> to you.</p> <p>A Miss Barrett from Ballylongford told  <lb/>me she heard from you. She wept  <lb/>when speaking of Michael, but, indeed, I  <lb/>have seen many others do the same. <lb/>He has the prayers of all the country- <lb/>side round here.
