Only Military forces are to be used, the<lb/>  police being withheld.  The City of Dublin is to be placed in a<lb/> state of siege.  The inhabitants are to be confined to their houses,<lb/>  wholesale arrests, comprising several hundred persons in Dublin &amp;<lb/>  throughout the Country, are to be made.  All persons who could<lb/>  exercise disciplinary control over the Volunteers in general are to<lb/>  be placed under arrest.  Various places in the City belonging to the<lb/>  Volunteers are to be seized by the Military, &amp; in the measures<lb/>   to be used for that purpose <hi rend="underline">carte blanche </hi> is given to the Military <lb/>  offficers, who are not merely empowered but directed to do whatever<lb/>  they deem necessary "without reference to Headquarters."</p>  <p>In order to secure a free hand for the Military as long<lb/>  as these operations may last, the intervention of important citizens <lb/>  is specially guarded against.  The Archbishop of Dublin is to be <lb/>  held a prisoner in his house, &amp; forbidden all access to his clergy<lb/>  &amp; people.  The Lord Mayor is to be isolated in like manner.<lb/>  Any meeting of citizens, however few, is to be made impossible during<pb/>
