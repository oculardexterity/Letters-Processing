                            <p>This letter was written by Dr. Charles F. Judd (1888-1922) to state that William Kelly (1862-1921), a staff clerk at the Royal Irish Constabulary, was suffering from acute gastritis and had been under Dr Judd&#39;s care from the 20 April and was not considered fit for duty until the 3 May. The letter also encloses a document concerning the movements of William Kelly from the 22 April to 1 May signed by William Kelly.</p>
