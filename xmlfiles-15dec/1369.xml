                            <p>This is a letter from Lancelot Worthy Horne (1875-1924), railway superintendent, to the command paymaster. The letter regards a journey made by a party, including Augustine Birrell (1850-1933), former chief secretary for Ireland. Horne states that many in the party did not hold valid tickets and that he was informed to apply for the payment of £14.17.6. </p>

L.W.Horne Superintendent of the Line London & North Western Railway, Office of Superintendent of the Line, Euston Station, London N.W. In your reply please refer to 85/6516W May 6th 1916. Dear Sir, We made special arrangements at the request of the Government for the journey of Rt.Hon. A.Birrell and party from London to Holyhead on Wednesday, April 26th. Some of the passengers held tickets, but seven had neither ticket nor warrant for same from Euston to Holyhead, and one passenger held a ticket from Euston to Chester only. We were requested by Captain Butler to apply for payment, and I shall be glad if you will kindly send me a warrant to cover the fares for seven first class passengers Euston to Holyhead (£14,17.6) and one first class passenger, Chester to Holyhead (15/-), and oblige. Yours faithfully L.W. Home per <gap/>  The Command Paymaster Irish Command, DUBLIN
