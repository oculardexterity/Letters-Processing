                            <p>This is a letter from Donald MacMaster to Harold John Tennant. The letter refers to a request to the War Office to send a dispatch to Dublin at the author&#39;s expense to find out the whereabouts of a maid who has went missing in Dublin on Easter Monday 1916.    MacMaster (1846-1922), was a British lawyer and politician. In 1910 he had been elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative member for the Chertsey division of Surrey. He held this seat until his death in 1922.    Tennant (1865-1935) was brother-in-law to the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and also acted as his assistant private secretary. Other posts which he occupied were financial secretary to the War Office from 1911-1912, under-secretary of state from 1912-1916 and secretary of Scotland from July 1916 to December 1916.</p>
