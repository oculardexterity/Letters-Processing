                            <p>Letter from Fr Jerome O&#39;Mahony SJ (1869-1930), 5th Canadian General Hospital, Salonika 1917 to his Father Provincial Thomas V Nolan SJ (1867-1941), 25 May 1916. He refers to the Easter Rising 1916, a conference of chaplains in Salonika, discussion on the dispensing of carrying an ordinary altar stone for those travelling on horseback, the numbers in hospital, their ailments and the 10th Division. He praises the work of Fr. O&#39; Connor of Clonfert diocese.    Fr Jerome O’Mahony SJ was born 28 November 1869 at Kilmallock, county Limerick  His family moved to Charleville, county Cork when he was a baby. Educated at the Christian Brothers, Charleville, Tullabeg and Clongowes Wood College, Fr. O’ Mahony taught at Clongowes Wood College, Belvedere College, Mungret College, Limerick, St. Ignatius, Galway, and Crescent College, Limerick, before the war. He served as a chaplain from 1915-1919.       </p>

Monsignor Cavendish <lb/> announced that the dispensing with ordinary altar stone for chaplains <lb/> who have to travel distances on horseback is under consideration <lb/> &amp; something like Agnus Dei with relics to be placed on altar to <lb/> be used instead. We had over 1100 in hospital here about <lb/> ten days ago &amp; <del>will</del> shall have about the same number in <lb/> the coming week as it is our receiving week ie the four <lb/> Gen. hospitals take week in turn to receive all cases of the <lb/> region that are likely to require treatment for anything over a <lb/> week the milder cases giving to Casualty stations &amp; Sta-<lb/> tionary hospitals. The big numbers in hospital are the <lb/> after effects of the cold and privations of the winter brought <lb/> to the surface by a wetting, extra long march etc. A great <lb/> many are 10th division who are about ten miles off.<lb/>  One section has a splendid priest seeing after them. Fr. O’ <lb/> Connor of Clonfert not unlike our Fr. Claffey. I have <lb/> hardly found one in hospital here belonging to his Sec-<lb/> tion who had not made his Easter duty. I hope all are keeping well at home. I must now conclude.</p> <closer><salute>With best wishes<lb/>   I remain<lb/>    <unclear>r<hi rend="superscript">de</hi> R<hi rend="superscript">al</hi></unclear>Servus in Xto <lb/></salute></closer> <!-- Servant in Christ -->                        <lb/> J.C.
