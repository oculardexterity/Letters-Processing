                            <p>This is a letter from Sir Thomas Little Heath (1861-1940), the secretary of the treasury, to the Under-Secretary Sir Robert Chalmers (1858–1938). The letter discusses the payment of the London and North Western Railway Company for the expense of seven party members that traveled with Augustine Birrell. The charge came to £15. 12s. 6d and Heath is directing Chalmers to the Foreign Office.     After the Easter rising of 1916 Chalmers was sent to Ireland as under-secretary, replacing Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939) who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell (1850-1933), his chief secretary. Heath was a British civil servant, mathematician, classical scholar, historian of ancient Greek mathematics, translator, and mountaineer.     </p>
