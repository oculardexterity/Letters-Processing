                            <p>This is a letter from Henry O&#39;Hanrahan (d. 1927)  to his mother Mary O&#39;Hanrahan (née Williams) and his sisters Eily, Aine and Máire. The letter was written from Portland prison in England and in the extract, Henry describes the rebel surrender, praises the women in his garrison and assures his mother than he is &#39;alright&#39;, noting that his brother is &#39;better off&#39; and that they had priests in regularly in Jacob&#39;s.    O&#39;Hanrhan was a brother of Michael O&#39;Hanrahan (1877-1916), nationalist and journalist. Michael served as quarter master general of the second battalion of the Irish Volunteers from 1915 and in 1916 was third in command, after Thomas MacDonagh and John MacBride, of the rebel garrison at Jacob&#39;s biscuit factory. He was executed on 4 May 1916. Henry O&#39;Hanrahan fought under his brother during the Easter Rising was was sentenced to penal servitude for life but was released in 1917.</p>
