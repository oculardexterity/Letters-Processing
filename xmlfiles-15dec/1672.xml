                            <p>This letter was written by Lady Hariot Georgine Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (nee Rowan-Hamilton) (1843-1936) to her daughter Lady Hermione Catherine Helen Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood (1869-1960). The letter concerns the Easter Rising. In the letter Hermoine&#39;s mother tells her that Hermione probably knows as much as she does about the events in Dublin as there are no papers in Dublin but plenty of rumours. Her mother then moves onto everyday events such as the weather and that a friend, Jenny, is going to have a baby. </p>
