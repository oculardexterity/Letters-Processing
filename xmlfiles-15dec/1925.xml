                            <p>A deportation order from David Lloyd George (1863–1945), the British Secretary of State for War concerning prisoner James Gough  who participated in the Easter Rising. Gough was first held at Richmond Barracks, was transferred to Stafford, and then was held at Frongoch Internment camp, Wales.    David Lloyd George took over the role of Secretary of State for War on 6 June 1916, after the death of Horatio Herbert Kitchener, (1850–1916) who died on board the cruiser HMS Hampshire when it was sunk by a German mine on 5 June 1916, while on course to Russia.</p>
