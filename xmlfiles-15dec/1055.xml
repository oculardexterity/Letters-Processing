                            <p>This is a letter from Amelia Jephson to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961)  on the 14th of June 1916. The writer apologises for the long lapse of time before writing and asks for a memento of her &#39;wonderful &amp; heroic husband&#39;. She did not hear of the memorial Mass in time - otherwise she would have been there. She proposes that she and Nancy do Lough Derg together. Finally, the writer indicates that she could visit Nancy. in conjunction to her regular visits to Lansdowne Road to see her ailing mother    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at its founding in 1914. She was the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916), who was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.</p>
