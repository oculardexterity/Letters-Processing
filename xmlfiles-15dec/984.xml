                            <p>This is a letter of condolence from Mary to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer expresses sincere sympathy on the death of O&#39;Rahilly and assures Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly of the prayers of her whole family. She asks after the children and Sara.    She was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.</p>

Bavin Kilcar Co. Donegal May 19th 1916. Dear Mrs O'Rahilly, Please accept my most sincere sympathy in your sad bereavement. It was with feelings of deep regret I learned the news of the dear Master's sad end. (R.I.P.) Words cannot express how sorry I feel at his death, and for yourself & the children, who only too well realize his loss. I will never forget to pray for the repose of his soul, which is the only thing I can do. Indeed many a fervent prayer has been offered up by all the members of the family. How is little Myles? He is a big boy now I'M sure. Give my love to the children all, and may God give you strenght to bear your cross. I remain Your faithful N______ Mary. P.S. I hope Sara is with you always. If so remember me to her. M.
