                            <p>This letter is from Kate English to her son Patrick. In this letter Kate informs Patrick that their family will be moving to the enclosed address as his sister, Nellie, has taken a big house for the family. In his application for a state pension, in recognition of his service, Patrick would later state that his family were evicted from their home in Dunsink as a result of his service during Easter Week.     Kate also informs Michael of the local news before ending the letter with the enclosure of a PO for one shilling so Patrick can buy some cigarettes.    This letter was written by Kate (b. 1855) to Patrick English (1894-1970) while he was interned. Patrick had been stationed in the G.P.O for the Rising. Following the surrender he was sent to Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales.                </p>
