                            <p>This letter was written by E. F. Batty to the under-secretary for Ireland. In this letter Batty writes concerning the provision of aeroplanes in areas of Ireland which contain enough troops to make it worthwhile. Batty thinks this would help to deter rebels.    The letter is addressed to the under-secretary, which at this time is Sir Robert Chalmers (1858-1938). Chalmers was sent to Ireland as under-secretary, replacing Sir Matthew Nathan who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell, his chief secretary following the Easter Rising in 1916.</p>
