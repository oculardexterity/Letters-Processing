                            <p>This letter was written by a group of Irish prisoners in Frongoch to William O&#39;Brien. The letter concerns the rations received by internees in the camp. According to the prisoners some of the meat being served to prisoners is &#39;unfit for human consumption&#39;. The letter states that this is the third time this has occurred and asks O&#39;Brien to let in &#39;the light of public opinion on the matter&#39;.    Frongoch Internment Camp in Wales was a makeshift prison used for the internment of approximately 1,800 Irishmen in the wake of the Easter Rising, 1916. It was to become known as the &#39;University of Revolution&#39; due to the influential effect it had on its inmates.    The letter was addressed to William O&#39;Brien (1852-1928). O&#39;Brien was an Irish nationalist politician serving as a Member of Parliament in the Britain from 1883 until he withdrew himself and his party in 1918. Among the signatories to this letter are Michael Staines, Thomas Sinnott and Richard Mulcahy.    Staines (1885 - 1955) was a member of the Irish Republic</p>

<address>Irish Prisoners,<lb/> Internment Camp,<lb/> Frongoch.</address>  <date>14th Oct. 1916.</date>  <address>Wm. O'Brien Esq., M.P.<lb/> House of Commons.</address>  <salute>Sir;=</salute> <p>We much regret the necessity which compells us to send to you<lb/>  additional complaints regarding the rations supplied to us by the<lb/>  authorities.  In accordance with the intention to refuse the ration<lb/>  of herrings as indicated in the second para. of the third item of<lb/>  our letter to you dated 11th inst., the prisoners' Quarter Master<lb/>  declined to take over the ration of herrings from the military<lb/>  yesterday, and asked that some other food stuffs be supplied in lieu.<lb/>   No other article of food would be issued in lieu; and yesterday's<lb/>  (Friday 13th inst.) dinner, in consequence, cost the prisoners<lb/>  Â£3:15:10, out of their private fund.</p> <p>This morning when the prisoners ration party attended the<lb/>  military stores for the purpose of drawing the daily meat ration, the<lb/>  prisoners Quarter Master complained to the Orderly Officer of the<lb/>  day that the meat, in his opinion, was unfit for human consumption,<lb/>  as the stench from it was very noticeable.  The officer admitted<lb/>  that the stench was bad, but that "if it was washed with vinegar and<lb/>  water the stench would disappear."  The military butcher remarked,<lb/>  in the hearing of the Quarter Master, that this meat was intended for<lb/>  the Guard, but that they refused it, and were supplied with sausages<lb/>  in lieu.  In view of the order and directions of the Orderly Officer,<lb/>  the prisoners' Quarter Master had no option but to accept the meat<lb/>  for the time being.  On arriving in Camp, the attention of the<lb/>  Head Camp Leader was drawn to the meat, and he called the doctor to<lb/>  the kitchen.  When he arrived in the Camp at 10 o'clock a.m. The<lb/>  military staff sergeant on duty in the Camp, on becoming aware of this<lb/>  notified the Adjutant, who came to the prisoners' kitchen shortly after<lb/>  the doctor, and immediately tried, by his language and attitude, to<lb/>  brow-beat the doctor, and was most insulting to the prisoners' Quarter<pb/>

Master.  The doctor, in view of the Adjutant's attitude, considered<lb/>  it advisable to call in his assistant, who at once condemned 176 lbs.<lb/>  out of a total of 268 lbs. as being utterly unfit for human<lb/>  consumption - that is a proportion of nearly 2/3 of the total.  The<lb/>  meat was then changed.</p> <p>You will agree with us that this is a serious state of affairs<lb/>  especially as it is the third occasion on which the meat had to be <lb/> condemned, as being utterly unfit, and we hope that you will<lb/>  endeavour to seize an early opportunity of letting in the light<lb/>  of public opinion on the matter.</p> <salute>We desire to remain, Sir,<lb/> Your obedient servants,</salute> Michael Staines          Head Leader.<lb/> J.J.
