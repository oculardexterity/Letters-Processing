                            <p>This letter is from James Maloney (b. 1896), and is addressed to Patrick English (1894-1970). In the letter Maloney states that English&#39;s last letter arrived safely and he will send him some cigarettes, notepaper and stamps. Maloney states that his glad Dublin is now quiet after seeing so much trouble. Maloney requests that English tells Cosgrave he was &#39;asking for him&#39;. He also informs English that he was released from Richmond Barracks. Maloney also discusses his injured brother, Peter (b.1894), who was wounded in the Battle of Loos. Maloney ends the letter by hoping that English, Cosgrave and all the boys will be released before long.     After the Easter Rising of 1916 Patrick English was interned at Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales</p>
