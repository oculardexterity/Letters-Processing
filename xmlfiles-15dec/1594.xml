                            <p>This letter was written by a group of Irish prisoners in Frongoch to Laurence Ginnell. The representatives want Ginnell to raise questions in parliament regarding the administration of a scheme in the camp whereby prisoners are entitled to a rebate of a percentage of what they have spent in the canteen.     Frongoch Internment Camp in Wales was a makeshift prison used for the internment of approximately 1,800 Irishmen in the wake of the Easter Rising, 1916. It was to become known as the &#39;University of Revolution&#39; because of the revolutionary nature of the inmates.    Laurence Ginnell (1852 – 1923) was an Irish nationalist politician, lawyer, and member of parliament. He initially ran as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, but, from 1910 onward he ran as an Independent Nationalist. Among the signatories to this letter are Michael Staines, Thomas Sinnott and Richard Mulcahy.    Staines (1885 - 1955) was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and served as Quartermaster in the GPO during the Easte</p>

Ginnell, Esq., B.A. B.L., M.P.<lb/> <salute>Sir,</salute> <p>We the undersigned being the duly elected leaders of the<lb/> above Camp would feel very much indebted to you if you could see<lb/> your way clear to having the following questions asked in<lb/> Parliament, at the earliest convenience :&#x2014;</p> <p>(1) What is the percentage of the rebate allowed to the<lb/> Irish Prisoners in Frongoch on their purchases in the Camp Canteen?<lb/> Is the percentage of the rebate allowed supposed to be fixed at 10%?<lb/> And if so, are the Camp Leaders or Prisoners' Auditor allowed to<lb/> see the Canteen A/C each month. If not, why not, considering that<lb/> it is solely the Prisoners' money that is being dealt with?</p> (3) How are the Prisoners to know that they are receiving a rebate<lb/> of 10% other than the system of merely letting the Leaders know<lb/> that they can draw on the Canteen Fund up to£10 per month (4) Is<lb/> it a fact that when there were 1,800 prisoners in the Camp in July<lb/> they were only allowed £4:10:0 while an average of 900 men<lb/> in August they received £10 and with 545 men in Sept. they also<lb/> received £10 (5) Why are not the Camp Leaders allowed to<lb/> purchase such goods as they think most suitable for the prisoners<lb/> in the way of food, tobacco, cigarettes, etc., considering that it is<lb/> solely the Prisoners' money?</p> <p>P.S. We would be glad if you would make inquiries<lb/> into the alleged connection of the Adjutant of the Camp &#x2014; Lieut.<lb/> J.T. Burns (who has charged of the Canteen Fund) with the officer of<lb/> that name connected with the Lipton scandal some few years ago.</p><pb/>
