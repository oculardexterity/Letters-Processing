                            <p>Letter from Power in the Irish Office, London to the under secretary for Ireland, Sir Robert Chalmers. Power relayed a question in Parliament put forward by William Doris inquiring whether there were plans to reduce the number of Irish prisoners, and if so, which prisons were to close.    Sir Robert Chalmers (1858-1938) was the under-secretary for Ireland. Chalmers became under-secretary for a brief period following the resignation of Matthew Nathan (1862-1939) following the 1916 Rising.     Doris (1860-1926), was an Irish Member of Parliament, belonging to the Irish Parliamentary Party) representing West Mayo.  </p>
