                            <p>This is a letter from M.L. Waller of the Home Office in Whitehall, London, to the commandant of Frongach internment camp in Wales. After the Easter Rising over 3,400 men and women were arrested and interned in prisons and camps in Ireland, England and Wales. The majority were released after a short imprisonment and eventually most of the men who remained imprisoned were transferred to Frongach in north Wales. By October 1916 there were still over 500 men interned there.  This letter refers to the case of a number of prisoners who were punished for refusing to perform &#39;fatigue duty&#39;. Walker asks that the remainder of the punishment be remitted and that the men are no longer asked to perform those duties.  This letter is contained in the collection of papers relating to the Cowan family of Drumcondra and their uncle, Seamus McGowan who was a captain in the Irish Citizen Army and was one of the men imprisoned in Frongach after the Rising.</p>

<note>To be posted on Notice Board in Prison</note> Home Office, Whitehall. 9th October 1916. 313206/. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that he has had under his consideration the case of the prisoners now under punishment for refusing to perform fatigue duty ordered by you (removal of rubbish from the guard's quarters), and it appears to him that they have now been sufficiently punished for this offence. He has therefore decided to remit the remainder of the punishment and also for the future to relieve them from this particular duty, which he understands from you can be properly performed by the guard. In announcing this decision to the prisoners, the Secretary of State desires that you should make it clear that in his opinion you were right in requiring them to perform this duty and right in punishing those who refused, but, the matter being a trifling one, he does not desire to carry the punishment further. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (sgd) M. L. Walker  The Commondant, Prisoner of War Camp, Frangoch.
