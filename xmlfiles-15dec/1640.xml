                            <p>This letter was written by Christopher Cox (b.1886) to the chief secretary of Ireland. .    The letter concerns Cox&#39;s claim for damages to his shop following the 1916 Rising. He states that on 27 April the military broke into his shop and that there were soldiers billeted there until Monday morning. Cox claims that when he returned to the shop the best of his stock was gone and £3 pounds was missing. Enclosed with the letter is statement of the monetary value of the damages that were incurred to Cox&#39;s business.    At this time there is no official chief secretary following the resignation of Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) on 3 May 1916. Birrell&#39;s resignation was a consequence of the 1916 Rising for which he accepted responsibility. His successor, Henry Edward Duke (1855-1939) was not officially appointed until 31 July 1916</p>
