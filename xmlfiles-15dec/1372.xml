                            <p>This is a letter from Mrs E. L. Chapman, wife of a London based solicitor, writing to an unknown recipient. She was writing to ask if there was anything that could be done to attempt to give a domestic servant by the name of Mary Keegan passage back to her employer. Keegan says that because of the outbreak of the Rising she is finding it difficult to return.</p>
