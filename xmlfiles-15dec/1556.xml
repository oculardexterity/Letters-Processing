                            <p>This is a letter from Ernest John Whitlock (b. 1861), an architect and surveyor from Yorkshire, to the chief secretary of Ireland. While the letter is addressed to the chief secretary, there was no active chief secretary at the time this letter was written. This is due to the fact that Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) resigned on 3 May 1916 following his administrational failure during the 1916 Rising while his successor, Henry Duke (1855-1939), did not formally accept the position until 31 June 1916. In the letter, Whitlock states his profession and the fact he is 50 (above the military service age) and has worked in the profession for 18 years. Whitlock then states that he wishes to offer his services to the Irish government for any work needed following the destruction of Dublin city due to the Easter Rising</p>
