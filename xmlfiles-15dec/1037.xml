                            <p>This is a letter from Caitlín Burgess (Brugha) (1879-1959) to Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958).  Caitlín Brugha apologises for missing Mrs. FitzGerald when she called to her house and indicates when she will be available for a further visit - she is likely to be out visiting (her husband) in hospital at certain times. She sympathises with Mrs. FitzGerald over what has happened her husband and says her own trouble was like a bad dream and she is not surprised that her baby daughter arrived earlier than expected. She also writes that her husband had had an operation and was in great pain, unable to sleep.    Caitlín Burgess was the wife of Cathal Brugha (Burgess) (née Kingston (1874-1922), second-in-command at the South Dublin Union during the Easter Rising 1916. He was badly woulded in action but survived. Desmond Fitzgerald was imprisoned for his part in the Rising. Mabel Fitzgerald was the wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). </p>
