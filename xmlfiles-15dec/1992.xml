                            <p>This letter, addressed to Florence, was written by Eileen McGowan (née O’Donovan Rossa), (1878 – 1963). Eileen offers to help Florence anytime she may require it, especially after all that Florence and many others in Dublin did last summer. She writes that the suffering in Ireland must be dreadful and that she would have sent money with the letter only for she had read that the British confiscate money sent in letters.    Eileen was one of eighteen children of the Fenian leader Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa (1831 – 1915). O’Donovan Rossa was an active figure in Irish politics from 1856 until 1906, until he immigrated to New York where he eventually passed away.   </p>
