                            <p>This is a letter from M. Kennedy to the chief secretary for Ireland warning of another rising involving Sinn FÃ©in. He writes that the rebels have no shortage of arms and that he believes that considering the rebellion, warnings about rebel activity is probably not paid much attention to.While the letter is addressed to the chief secretary, there was no active chief secretary at the time this letter was written.     This is due to the fact that Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) resigned on 3 May 1916 following his administrational failure during the 1916 Rising and his successor, Henry Duke (1855-1939), did not formally accept the position until 31 June 1916. </p>
