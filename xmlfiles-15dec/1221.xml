                            <p>This letter was written by Denis Mangan (1894-1981) to Anna O&#39;Rahilly (d.1958), offering his condolences upon the death of her brother Michael. In the letter Denis, who is on a mission in Africa, comments on the Rising, stating that it was a hopeless affair but that he believes the rebels had the best intentions and that hopefully some good can come from the sacrifice.     Michael Joseph &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875â€“1916) was a nationalist and a journalist. In 1916 he aligned himself with Eoin MacNeill and Bulmer Hobson who opposed a preemptive rising. Although O&#39;Rahilly played a large role in delivering MacNeill&#39;s countermanding order he felt obligated to stand with the men he recruited and trained. O&#39;Rahilly was fatally wounded on the Thursday 27 April when the GPO was being evacuated.   </p>

<hi rend="underline">Aug 11th, 16</hi> R. C. Mission Kamuli Busoga B. E. Africa My Dear Anna The sad news has reached me of poor Michael's tragic death and I feel I must send a word of condolence to you & Nell. It is a long way from Central Africa to Ballylongford but my thoughts have travelled back there many times since I heard of Michael's death. That rising was indeed, a foolish and hopeless affair, but no doubt, those who took part in it, did so with the best intentions. Let us hope that some good may come from the sacrifice of so many noble-minded fellows. You and Nell must naturally feel the death of your only brother and therefore I wish to say that I feel for you in your bereavement. With kindest regards I am Yours very sincerely D. M. Mangan

Africa</addrLine></address> <salute>My Dear Anna</salute></opener> <p>The sad news has<lb/>  reached me of poor Michael's tragic death and I feel I must send<lb/>  a word of condolence to you &amp; Nell.</p> <p>It is a long way from Central <lb/> Africa to Ballylongford but my thoughts<lb/>  have travelled back there many times<lb/>  since I heard of Michael's death.</p> <p>That rising was, indeed, a foolish<lb/>  and hopeless affair, but no doubt,<lb/>  those who took part in it, did so with<lb/>  the best intentions. Let us hope that<lb/> some good may come from the sacrifice <lb/> of so many noble-minded fellows.</p> <p>You and Nell must naturally<lb/>  feel the death of your only brother and<lb/>  therefore I wish to say that I feel for you<lb/>  in your bereavement.</p> <closer><salute>With kindest regards<lb/> I am<lb/> Yours very sincerely</salute></closer> D.
