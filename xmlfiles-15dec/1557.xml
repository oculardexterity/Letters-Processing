                            <p>This is a letter from John McLoughlin (1864-1944) to Robert Chalmers (1858-1938), the under-secretary to Ireland. Robert Chalmers assumed the role in 1916 for a brief period following the resignation of Matthew Nathan (1862-1939), after accepting political failure during the 1916 Easter Rising. The letter concerns McLoughlin&#39;s son, Cornelius Fredrick McLoughlin (1897-1939), Irish volunteer who was interned following the Easter Rising. McLoughlin states that he son moved in with his aunt Minnie Heffernan (d. 1944), going on to state that he wishes for his son to be dealt with firmly. The letter then states that McLoughlin attempted to convince his son to join the British army but failed. The letter also discusses Cornelius&#39; attempt to go to America. McLoughlin states that he does not know how his son came to know the &#39;evil company&#39; of &#39;Sinn Fein&#39;, and that he has no sympathy for his son.

I spent a considerable sum of money<lb/>  in the bringing up and education of this boy, up to<lb/>  the summer examinations of last year, where he com-<lb/> pleted his Intermediate course. As he was young, able,<lb/>  active, clever and physically fit, and in my opinion <lb/> eminently suitable for His Majesty's forces, I did my<lb/>  utmost during the autumn of last year to induce him <lb/> to join the O.T.C or other branch of the regular forces<lb/>  but failed. As he had no taste for soldiering and as<pb/>

            he expressed a wish to go seek his fortune in<lb/>  America and join friends who are out there, <lb/> and so I had no employment for him here.  I con-<lb/> sented to his wish. It was just then that the<lb/>  stampede of young men took place which caused<lb/>  the Government to prevent the departure of passengers<lb/>  unless provided with passports. He filed papers with <lb/> the view of getting one,  and as he saw there were some<lb/>  obstacles put in the way, he allowed the matter drop<lb/>  and changed his mind. As he was not willing to join<lb/>  the army or go to America and so I had no business<lb/> for him, he went to his aunt's at Glenmore. While<lb/>  under my charge he never mixed with any evil <lb/> companions, what evil company he met with since<lb/>  he left me I do not know. How or when he became <lb/> connected with this Sein Finn business, if he has been<lb/>  so connected, I have no knowledge. I need hardly say<lb/>  I have no sympathy for him in his present miserable<lb/>  predicament, and that is my reason for saying that <lb/> I trust he may be fittingly punished if there is any<lb/>  evidence of guilt brought home to him, as I do<lb/>  not believe in making heroes of young fellows <lb/> by arrest and discharge without adequate punish-<lb/> ment, which would be a lessen to them in the future.</p> <p>As I look upon this attempted insurrection as the<lb/>  greatest curse that could befall this unhappy land<pb/>
