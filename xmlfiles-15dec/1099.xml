<address>45 Moyderwell, Tralee.</address> <date>18th May 1916</date> <lb/>URGENT. <salute>Dear Sir</salute> <p>I have received the following recommendations from <lb/> Headquarters of the National Volunteers, with directions to have them <lb/>issued immediately to the various Registered Companies in the County:</p> <lb/>(1) MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL VOLUNTEERS. <p>Some members of the National Volunteers have been put under  <lb/>arrest by the Military within the past few days. Possibly under  <lb/>the circumstances this was unavoidable and apparently some Military  <lb/>Officers have failed to discriminate between what are termed Sinn  <lb/>Finers and National Volunteers (under the leadership <sic>pf</sic> Mr John <lb/> Redmond M. P.).Representations on this important matter have been  <lb/>made from this Office (Headquarters) to His Excellency the Lord <lb/> Lieutenant and these have been conveyed by His Excellency to the <lb/> Commander-in-Chief, Dublin, who has, through his Chief of Staff, expressed  <lb/>a desire to facilitate certain Officers of the National Volunteers <lb/>nominated by Headquarters to verify otherwise the statements of  <lb/>person sunder arrest who claim to have been members of the National  <lb/>Volunteers and who have taken no part in the recent disturbances.</p> <p>If any such arrests have been made within your District <lb/> immediate steps similar to those taken in Dublin should be taken to <lb/> obtain their release. Officers verifying the statements of persons <lb/> under arrest who claim to be National Volunteers, should be cautioned  <lb/>to exercise great care and to deal only with cases of bona fide  <lb/>National Volunteers who have not been concerned in the recent disturb- <lb/>ances. They should not interfere in the case of any other person.</p> <lb/>(2) ARMS AND AMMUNITION. <p>As the Proclamation requiring the surrender of Arms and <lb/> Ammunition refers only to members of the the Sinn Fein Irish Volunteers <lb/> and of the Citizen Army, it is not necessary for National Volunteers  <lb/>to deliver up their arms, but they should notify the local police of any <lb/>arms and ammunition in their possession. </p> <p>Where the arms of the Company of the Battalion are kept at <lb/>Headqs., or such other place as ordered by the Company or Battalion <lb/>the arms and ammunition are to notify the local police whilst retaining <lb/>possession of the Arms and Ammunition.</p> <p> If, however, the military or police demand possession no <lb/>opposition should be offered but a receipt singed by an Officer or <lb/>Sergeant of Police for the Arms or Ammunition taken."</p> <p>I hope, therefore, that you will act without delay on these <lb/> instructions and let me know what you ave done in the matter.</p> <p>I would also be obliged if you would let me have a general <lb/>report, for the information of Headquarters, a to the attitude of <lb/>the National Volunteers in your District during the recent lamentable <lb/>occurrences.</p>  <salute>Yours faithfully,</salute> <signed>Frank O'Donnell</signed> <lb/>Hon.
