                            <p>This is a letter of condolence to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961).   This letter expresses the sympathy of &#39;all the Sisters &amp; many boarders&#39;. The writer thinks often and prays for Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly and her deceased husband. The writer asks for a supply of mortuary cards and hopes the children are a comfort to her.    She was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.</p>
