                            <p>George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising. His legal practice represented many of those detained in the aftermath of the Rising.  Austin Stack (1879-1929) was commandant of the Kerry Brigade of the Irish Volunteers in 1916. He was arrested in the aftermath of the Easter Rising and interned in the Prison Camp at Frongoch, Wales.  Michael Collins (1890 â€“ 1922) was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and he took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the Easter Rising. He fought in the GPO alongside Pearse and Connolly and was arrested after the surrender. He escaped execution and instead, along with up to 1,800 others, was interned in the Prison Camp at Frongoch, Wales.  General Sir John Maxwell (1859 - 1929) was primarily responsible for government policy in the immediate aftermath of the Rising. Maxwell was in sole charge of trials and sentences by &#39;field genera</p>

<date>4th October 1916.</date><lb/> Messers Corrigan &amp; Corrigan.<lb/> Dear Sirs:&#x2014;<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Re: Irish Prisoners:&#x2014;</hi><lb/> <p>I <hi rend="underline">enclose</hi> the documents set out at the end of this letter.<lb/> <hi rend="underline">Please return to me</hi> in due course the bundle from Dr. O'Connell<lb/> relating to the case of Counsel <hi rend="underline">re</hi> Stack and Collins of which I<lb/> have kept no copy.</p><lb/> <p>1. Correspondence sent herewith includes a letter of 16th May<lb/> last to Mr Healy showing conclusively that there was no Statutory<lb/> authority for the trial <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> of the prisoners who were so tried<lb/> in Ireland, that is the great majority of those tried after the Rising.<lb/> Mr Ginnell and others put questions in the House repeatedly on this<lb/> point and obtained evasive and contradictory answers the general<lb/> effect of which was that there was some unspecified authority in the<lb/> Defence of the Realm Regulations recognising <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> proceedings<lb/> before a court&#x2014;martial, but ultimately Mr Ginnell elicited from<lb/> Mr Asquith that the military authorities have to justify themselves<lb/> by the please that the <add><hi rend="underline">public interest</hi></add> was sufficient warranty for<lb/> excluding the public. The dicta of the Lords of Appeal in <hi rend="underline">Hollinshead</hi><lb/> <hi rend="underline">v. Hazleton</hi> decided by the House of Lords last December would, I think<lb/> be helpful to show the great difficulty of setting up public interest<lb/> as an excuse for violating public right. You will see that if<lb/> proceeding <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> cannot be justified the great majority of the<lb/> prisoners who have been tried are entitled to <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus.</hi> </p><lb/> <p>2. You will also find a copy of Dr. O'Connell's letter to me<lb/> of 29th July and my reply of 9th August last relating to Stack and<lb/> Collins who seem to me to have a very strong claim.

You will see that they are both convicted <lb/>of conspiracy and the evidence against them is anything but strong. <lb/>I think a victory in the Courts in their case would have a very <lb/>good moral effect. You will notice that the correspondence here <lb/>deals with the question of the right of <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus</hi> running from <lb/>England to Ireland and <hi rend="underline">vice versa.</hi></p> <p>3. A very important question indeed which is worth of <lb/>Counsels best consideration is the point as to the authority, if <lb/>any, by which a person convicted in Ireland is sent to an English <lb/>prison. My view is that there is a great deal to be said against <lb/>such a transfer and that the military authorities would have the <lb/>utmost difficulty in supporting their action. Probably there would <lb/>be less difficulty in supporting the transfer of people who are <lb/>merely interned, but Counsel might also consider this.</p> <p>4. It would be well to supply Counsel not only with one <lb/>of the notices of an order of internment as supplied to each <lb/>interned person, but also with a copy of an actual order of <lb/>internment, I mean a copy of the order itself, not the notice. <lb/>I think it will be found that the order in every case specifies <lb/>Frongoch as <del>a</del> <add>the</add> place of internment and a client of mine at Reading <lb/>Gaol has raised the question whether it would be worth while <lb/>applying for <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus</hi> on this ground, since Reading is not <lb/>Frongoch. I think we might score a technical success by such an <lb/>application, but I am not sure if it is worth while as a new order <lb/>could easily be made by the competent authority.</p> <p>5. It will be important that Counsel should have the <lb/> very recentest edition of the Defence of the Realm Regulations <lb/>Consolidated from Ponsonby's <del>which refers</del><add>w.refce</add> to one of the questions <lb/>which you are submitting to Counsel<add>,</add> <add>it</add> may be worth mentioning <lb/>that Regulation 14b of the Defence of the Realm Regulations <lb/>was amended by an order dated 8th June 1916 (reported in <hi rend="underline">Solicitors'</hi> <lb/><hi rend="underline">Journal</hi> 17th June 1916 and probably included in the latest print

<date>4th October 1916.</date> <lb/>Messrs Corrigan &amp; Corrigan. <salute>Dear Sirs-</salute>; <lb/><hi rend="underline">Re: Irish Prisoners:</hi>&#x2014; <p>I <hi rend="underline">enclose</hi> the documents set out at the end of this letter. <lb/><hi rend="underline">Please return to me</hi> in due course the bundle from Dr. O'Connell <lb/>relating to the case of Counsel <hi rend="underline">re</hi> Stack and Collins of which I <lb/>have kept no copy.</p> <p>1. Correspondence sent herewith includes a letter of 16th May <lb/>last to Mr Healy showing conclusively that there was no Statutory <lb/>authority for the trial <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> of the prisoners who were so tried <lb/>in Ireland, that is the great majority of those tried after the Rising. <lb/>Mr Ginnell and others put questions in the House repeatedly on this <lb/>point and obtained evasive and contradictory answers the general <lb/>effect of which was that there was some unspecified authority in the <lb/>Defence of the Realm Regulations recognising <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> proceedings <lb/>before a court-martial, but ultimately Mr Ginnell elicited from <lb/>Mr Asquith that the military authorities have to justify themselves <lb/>by the plea that the <hi rend="underline">public interest</hi> was sufficient warranty for <lb/>excluding the public. The dicta of the Lords of Appeal in <hi rend="underline">Hollinshead</hi> <lb/><hi rend="underline">v. Hazleton</hi> decided by the House of Lords last December would, I think <lb/>be helpful to show the great difficulty of setting up public interest <lb/>as an excuse for violating public right. You will see that if <lb/>proceedings <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> cannot be justified the great majority of the <lb/>prisoners who have been tried are entitled to <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus.</hi> </p> <p>2. You will also find a copy of Dr. O'Connell's letter to me <lb/>of 29th July and my reply of 9th August last relating to Stack and <lb/>Collins who seem to me to have a very strong claim.

<opener><dateline><date>4th October 1916.</date></dateline> Messrs Corrigan &amp; Corrigan. <salute>Dear Sirs-</salute></opener>; <lb/><hi rend="underline">Re: Irish Prisoners:</hi>&#x2014; <p>I <hi rend="underline">enclose</hi> the documents set out at the end of this letter. <lb/><hi rend="underline">Please return to me</hi> in due course the bundle from Dr. O'Connell <lb/>relating to the case of Counsel <hi rend="underline">re</hi> Stack and Collins of which I <lb/>have kept no copy.</p> <p>1. Correspondence sent herewith includes a letter of 16th May <lb/>last to Mr Healy showing conclusively that there was no Statutory <lb/>authority for the trial <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> of the prisoners who were so tried <lb/>in Ireland, that is the great majority of those tried after the Rising. <lb/>Mr Ginnell and others put questions in the House repeatedly on this <lb/>point and obtained evasive and contradictory answers the general <lb/>effect of which was that there was some unspecified authority in the <lb/>Defence of the Realm Regulations recognising <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> proceedings <lb/>before a court-martial, but ultimately Mr Ginnell elicited from <lb/>Mr Asquith that the military authorities have to justify themselves <lb/>by the plea that the <hi rend="underline">public interest</hi> was sufficient warranty for <lb/>excluding the public. The dicta of the Lords of Appeal in <hi rend="underline">Hollinshead</hi> <lb/><hi rend="underline">v. Hazleton</hi> decided by the House of Lords last December would, I think <lb/>be helpful to show the great difficulty of setting up public interest <lb/>as an excuse for violating public right. You will see that if <lb/>proceedings <hi rend="underline">in camera</hi> cannot be justified the great majority of the <lb/>prisoners who have been tried are entitled to <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus.</hi> </p> <p>2. You will also find a copy of Dr. O'Connell's letter to me <lb/>of 29th July and my reply of 9th August last relating to Stack and <lb/>Collins who seem to me to have a very strong claim. The committal

            <hi rend="underline">Messrs Corrigan &amp; Corrigan (2) <date>4/10/16</date>.</hi> <lb/>warrant in the case of Collins is identical with that in the case <lb/> of Stack (copy <hi rend="underline">herewith</hi>). You will see that they are both convicted <lb/>of conspiracy and the evidence against them is anything but strong. <lb/>I think a victory in the Courts in their case would have a very <lb/>good moral effect. You will notice that the correspondence here <lb/>deals with the question of the right of <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus</hi> running from <lb/>England to Ireland and <hi rend="underline">vice versa.</hi></p> <p>3. A very important question indeed which is worth of <lb/>Counsels best consideration is the point as to the authority, if <lb/>any, by which a person convicted in Ireland is sent to an English <lb/>prison. My view is that there is a great deal to be said against <lb/>such a transfer and that the military authorities would have the <lb/>utmost difficulty in supporting their action. Probably there would <lb/>be less difficulty in supporting the transfer of people who are <lb/>merely interned, but Counsel might also consider this.</p> <p>4. It would be well to supply Counsel not only with one <lb/>of the notices of an order of internment as supplied to each <lb/>interned person, but also with a copy of an actual order of <lb/>internment, I mean a copy of the order itself, not the notice. <lb/>I think it will be found that the order in every case specifies <lb/>Frongoch as <del>a</del> <add>the</add> place of internment and a client of mine at Reading <lb/>Gaol has raised the question whether it would be worth while <lb/>applying for <hi rend="underline">habeas corpus</hi> on this ground, since Reading is not <lb/>Frongoch. I think we might score a technical success by such an <lb/>application, but I am not sure if it is worth while as a new order <lb/>could easily be made by the competent authority.</p> <p>5. It will be important that Counsel should have the <lb/> very recentest edition of the Defence of the Realm Regulations <lb/>Consolidated from Ponsonby's <del>which refers</del><add>w.refce</add> to one of the questions <lb/>which you are submitting to Counsel<add>,</add> <add>it</add> may be worth mentioning <lb/>that Regulation 14b of the Defence of the Realm Regulations <lb/>was amended by an order dated 8th June 1916 (reported in <hi rend="underline">Solicitors'</hi> <lb/><hi rend="underline">Journal</hi> 17th June 1916 and probably included in the latest print

             <p>I think the "Frongoch" argument is technically  <lb/> sound but as it is only technical it does not really  <lb/> carry very far because the mistake can easily be corrected</p>  <p>The "Alien" argument is based on a misapprehension  <lb/> The Aliens advisory committee is expressly authorised  <lb/> under r. 14 B. to deal with all persons interned under  <lb/> that regulation but it is not necessary that such persons  <lb/> should be aliens themselves.</p>   <p>The only court to which application can be made  <lb/> seems to me to be the High Court of Justice, and the only  <lb/> application one for Habeas Corpus.</p>   <p> The argument based on section 2 of the Defence  <lb/> of the Realm Amendment Act perplexes the advisory committee  <lb/> presumably because that Committee did not know that a  <lb/> Defendant in an Irish Police Court cannot give evidence  <lb/> on his own behalf as that is the law of Ireland in criminal  <lb/> cases; there is an exception to that law, I believe, under  <lb/> the Army Act which allows a soldier Courtmartialled  in <lb/> Ireland to give evidence on his own behalf in the same  <lb/> way as in England when the Defence of the Realm Amendment  <lb/> Act was passed, the question arose whether a civilian who  <lb/> might thereafter be tried by Court Martial in Ireland

            <lb/>was to be tried according to the procedure governing Irish  <lb/> Police Courts or according to the procedure governing  <lb/> Courts Martial, and the legislature evident by Section 2  <lb/> of the amending Act intended to make it clear that the  <lb/> ordinary civil procedure in the matter of evidence by a  <lb/> Defendant was to apply to a civilian who might be Court  <lb/> martialled in  Ireland under the new Act or regulations.</p>  <p>Moreover as internees under r. 14 B. are not charged  <lb/> with any <hi rend="underline">"offence"</hi>, Section 2 certainly does not imply  <lb/> that they have a right to call evidence before the  <lb/> Advisory Committee or elsewhere; in proceedings by Habeas  <lb/> Corpus the evidence is given by affidavit and the affidavit  <lb/> may be made by the applicant or a friend or a relative.</p>
