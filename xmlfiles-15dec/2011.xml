                            <p>Letter from Jeannie Adams (d. 1936), to her sister Annie Adams (1889- 1966). In this letter Jeannie thanks Annie for her recent letter and card. She writes that she attended Church twice on Easter Sunday and thought of her brother &#39;Poor Johnnie&#39; who had been home &#39;this time last year&#39;.     Jeannie Adams, born Jane Adams, later emigrated to Auckland, New Zealand, where she died in 1936. During the Great War, her brother John Adams (1890-1971), served with the 9th (Service) Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers. He spent the winter of 1915-16 in the trenches near the Somme valley. John Adams was wounded two months before the Battle of the Somme and spent Christmas 1916 in a camp in Tipperary. After returning to the Western Front in early 1917, he was involved in the Battle of Messines and further fighting in Ypres (Passchendaele). He was seriously wounded in October 1918, a few weeks before the end of the war.    </p>

I suppose Easter was very quiet <lb/> well I was at Church twice on Sunday the Soldiers were at <lb/> the morning service there was a good many I was thinking <lb/> of Poor Johnnie he was here this time last year.  I saw <lb/> Cissie Crozier and Annie and Sara on Saturday night <lb/> the asked me down to Annie on Monday, so Sara came <lb/> up for me in the afternoon and we went down round the <lb/> shore the tide was full in and it was lovely.  Leonard Brown <lb/> was down he isn't bad wee chap at all  I was talking <lb/> to him a good while he was telling me all the news about <lb/> home he says his Father is very ill he was in a bad way <lb/> about him he said he wanted Jimmie and Davie Crozier <lb/> to come with him  I wish Jimmie had come they all went. <lb/> up to town about five they wanted me to go with them but I <lb/> did not go.  I wonder did he get home.  Sometimes the  <lb/> Crozier are not bad.  they always ask me to go with them <lb/>if the are for minnie or anywhere <pb/>  I think this is near about <lb/> all as its near bed time <lb/> I hope you will write me <lb/> a good long letter soon has Jimmie <lb/> the potatoes all in <lb/> yet.  The weather has been <lb/> nice this last few days <lb/> was Thomas Moffatt home at <lb/> Easter I don’t think any <lb/> of the boy got any leave <lb/> the might later on.</p> <p>Write soon give my love <lb/> to all <closer><salute> I remain your <lb/> Loving Sister </salute></closer>Jeannie<lb/> Write soon</p>
