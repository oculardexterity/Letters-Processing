                            <p>This copy of a letter was addressed to the commandant of the Irish prisoners in Frongach Internment Camp in Wales.The writer advises the commandant that Mrs Gavan Duffy, wife of George Gavan Duffy, has requested, on her husband&#39;s behalf, a copy of an official document relating to discipline among prisoners of war as Gavan Duffy is representing prisoner P. Daly at his forthcoming trial. The writer states that they will enclose a copy of the relevant Royal Warrant  and  that Mrs Gavan Duffy was advised that her husband should now apply to the camp commandant for a copy.    George Gavan Duffy, (1882-1951), was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising. His legal practice represented many of those detained in the aftermath of the Rising. </p>
