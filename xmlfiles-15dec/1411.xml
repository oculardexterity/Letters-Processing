                            <p>This letter is from Kate English to her son Patrick. In the letter Kate discusses a parcel she had sent to Patrick and a visit she had from Mrs McMahon. The letter goes on to discuss an incident with Lady Holm Patrick, Edina Conyngham (1888â€“1964). According to the letter, Lady Holm Patrick slipped at the hall door and injured her shoulder.     This letter was written by Kate (b.1855) to Patrick English (1894-1970) while he was interned. Patrick had been stationed in the G.P.O for the Rising. Following the surrender he was sent to Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales.</p>
