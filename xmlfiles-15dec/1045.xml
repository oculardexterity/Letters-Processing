                            <p>This is a letter from Cis M Coyle to James Ryan (1891-1970) on 25 June 1916. This letter was written while Ryan was a prisoner in Stafford. The writer refers to mutual friends at home and those imprisoned after the Rising and discusses the weather in Wales where many of the Rising prisoners were being sent.      James Ryan studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna FÃ¡il and a government minister.  </p>
