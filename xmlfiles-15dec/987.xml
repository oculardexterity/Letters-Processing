                            <p>This is a letter from Laurence Ginnell (1852-1923) to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961).  Ginnell thanks Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly for information supplied and asks for more from her and her friends. He describes his own grief on learning of the death of Mr. O&#39;Rahilly. He goes on to tell Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly about two &#39;schemes&#39; with which he is involved: one to publish an account of the &#39;facts&#39; of the insurrection and another to create a dependent&#39;s fund.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.  Laurence Ginnell was an Irish Nationalist politician and MP in the House of Commons as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party.</p>

At length<lb/> it <sic>appeard</sic>, first in the <hi rend="underline">globe</hi>, and I thought my<lb/> heart would break. The soul of frankness and<lb/> chivalry in the bloom of youth cut off. I was<lb/> alone Mrs G. being in Ireland unable to return here.</p>

            <p>No on to speak to who could understand.<lb/> When at length she returned, I threw myself<lb/> on her lap and cried bitterly. English servants<lb/> thought I had gone mad. "My poor dear<lb/> O'Rahilly dead. So manly, so grand looking,<lb/> so grander still in manner and at heart."</p> <p>If I suffered so, God alone knows<lb/> how much you must have suffered.<lb/> there is, of course, the vast consolation that<lb/> he laid down his life in the cause and in<lb/> the manner that makes him immortal to<lb/> our race. It would be terrible if no<lb/> photograph remained of one who was so <lb/> dearly loved by countless thousands.<lb/> We must do all we can to avert that.</p> <p>I wish you to know about two<lb/> schemes we have in hands, so that you<lb/> may give us the benefit of any suggestions<pb/> that occur to you, and may mention<lb/> them to friends willing to co-operate.</p> <p>1. We want as soon as possible, all<lb/> authentic facts of the insurrection, while they are<lb/> fresh in the minds of witnesses, to have a<lb/> connected narrative codified by a competent<lb/> hand, done in English, French, Spanish, etc.<lb/> and circulated all over the world; to<lb/> counteract the lies of the enemy.</p> <p>2. We are energetically organising the<lb/> collection of a friend in London and throughout<lb/> Britain for relief of dependants of all sufferers<lb/> but especially of those whose men are dead,<lb/> and <add>who</add> <del>what</del> will neither get nor take from any<lb/> other source.</p> <p>We are trying to get a committee formed<lb/> in Dublin for each of those great purposes.</p> <p>With deepest sympathy from Mrs. Ginnell<lb/> and myself, I remain, Dear Madam O'Rahilly</p> <closer><salute>Sincerely yours</salute> <signed>L.
