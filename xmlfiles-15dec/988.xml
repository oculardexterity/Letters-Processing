                            <p>This is a letter of condolence from Julia Evans to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer expresses sorrow for Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly&#39;s loss. The writer&#39;s own husband was recently released and was in a terrible state, having been wounded in action at the South Dublin Union - she describes the bad treatment of her husband by &#39;G-Men&#39;, detective in G Unit of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Mrs. Evans&#39; husband is hoping to get his old job back but in the meantime they are in need of charitable assistance - she asks Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly to put them in touch with a charitable committee.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.</p>

            the treatment there was cruel. until<lb/> some of the M. P.'s. went to interview <lb/> the prison and then they got a little<lb/> better. it is <sic>miraculos</sic> my husband <lb/> being released it was all through<lb/> prayer. A. Byrne  the M.P. did a lot<lb/> for him. He was very much the worse<lb/> of what he went through and come <lb/> home to me a complete wreck.<lb/> his suit he could not wear it<lb/> any more. and he has no boots.<lb/> The boots he got in the Union remain<lb/> here we intend to keep them as<lb/> a memento. and his overcoat also<lb/> gone. His place of <sic>Busssiness</sic> was<lb/> was badly looted. and they are <lb/> not started yet. He was charge<lb/> of the Hat dept. in Mr McEvoy's of <lb/> Redmonds Hill.
