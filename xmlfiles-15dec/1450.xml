                            <p>This is a letter from Robert Anderson (b. 1860), the honourable secretary for the Irish Association of the Volunteers Training Corps, to Edward O&#39;Farrell (1857-1926), the assistant under-secretary for Ireland. This was an association which comprised of men who were over the age to actively engage in military service set up to have a home defence force to prevent a German invasion. The letter notes that the full number of special constables required for the Dublin Metropolitan Police in the aftermath of the Easter Rising has been acquired. Anderson also notes this information has been sent to the commissioner, with whom he has only had verbal contact. </p>
