Now that<lb/> you are again at large I cannot refrain from<lb/> giving expression to my feelings in your regard.<lb/> When growing up a boy at home little did I<lb/> think, much less hope, that the day, the glorious<lb/> day would come when one of my own birth<pb/>  <foreign><p>lig.

            and kin, one in whose veins flowed somewhat of<lb/> the Mangan blood would become a victim of<lb/> England's cruel <del>tny</del> tyranny for the love and<lb/> the honour of dear <unclear>Dark</unclear> Rosalin. Thanks be to<lb/> God I have lived to see the day. And from<lb/> my heart I congratulate you dear Nell in<lb/> being the privileged one destined by a wise<lb/> and a good Providence to suffer for so<lb/> noble, so grand, so magnanimous, so high -<lb/> souled a cause.</p> <p>Dominic told me that he called on you and found<lb/> you in the best of spirits although undergoing the<lb/> direst of cruelties. <foreign>Beannacht Dé i na magihde <lb/> murte ort a capa Sil</foreign>. While you were suffering<pb/> I was praying God to cheer your desolate heart and<lb/> strengthen your much tried nerve. I know too that<lb/> your darling boy is far from you at this moment<lb/> but the thought that he, like his brave uncle, is<lb/> a willing victim to the same cruel law, will I am<lb/> <add>sure</add>be a consolation to you. For him as for you all I pray<lb/> every morning when I hold in my hands at mass the truest<lb/> love of this nation that ever lived.</p> <p>Now Nell I am going to make two requests.<lb/> the first is will you send me some souvenir of Michael.<lb/> I don't care what it is provided it was his and used<lb/> by him. Something that I can keep. not therefore anything<lb/> of gold or of silver and nothing that would be too large<lb/> for me to keep continually either on me or in my room.<lb/> the second request is this. A friend of mine - a priest -<lb/> a true Irishman and a I.V. is going to the U.S.A next<pb/>

            week. I was telling him of the treatment you received in prison<lb/> and asked him to make it known over the way. I am anxious<lb/> to get information from yourself and if you wish it will<lb/> keep your name secret. Would it be too much then to ask you<lb/> drop me a few lines telling</p> 1) How long you were imprisoned.<lb/> 2) What sort of a room you had. Had you a bed; a chair<lb/> etc.<lb/> 3) What were the sanitary arrangements.<lb/> 4)How you got your meals and the quality of them.<lb/> 5) Were the officials civil in demanding information.<lb/> 6) Did they give you any reason for the arrest.<lb/> <p>I hope I am not bothering you too much but I know that you<lb/> love dear Granuaile and are ready to do anything to<lb/> better her at this dark and saddest of hours.<lb/> I am going from here next week; but if you write to<lb/> St. Joseph's Dundalk the letter will be forwarded.<lb/> Now for a wee bit of Gaelic.</p> <foreign>brod misreac agat a cara díl.
