                            <p>This is a letter from Kathleen Hogan to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961), 29 May 1916. Kathleen regrets that she will not be able to attend the memorial Mass (for The O&#39;Rahilly) in Dublin and says that it would comfort Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly to hear how her late husband is spoken of. She urges Nancy to keep strong for her two fine boys and the &#39;little Sunbeam which I hope is coming to cheer you&#39;.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at its founding in 1914. She was the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-styled as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916), who was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.  </p>
