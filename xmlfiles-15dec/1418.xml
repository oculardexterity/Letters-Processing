                            <p>This is a letter from Patrick English to his mother Kate. In the letter Patrick describes the Frongoch conditions to his mother. According to Patrick if it were not for the rain the camp &#39;would be all right&#39;. Patrick also tells his mother not to visit as he believes it would be a waste of money.    Patrick English (1894-1970) wrote this letter while he was interned. Patrick had been stationed in the G.P.O for the Rising. Following the surrender he was sent to Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales.</p>
