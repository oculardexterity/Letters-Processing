                            <p>The is a letter sent by F. L. C. Houd, the assistant secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, to Robert Chalmers (1858-1938) Under Secretary for Ireland.Chalmers became Under secretary for a brief period following the resignation of Matthew Nathan (1862-1939), who relinquished his position following his political failure during the 1916 Easter Rising. The letter concerns an enclosure of a letter from Mr John Mitchell Moubray (b. 1856) in which he applies to acquire a permit for the travel of one of his Irish workers. In the enclosed letter he states that John Campbell, the Irish worker, has worked for him for 25 years and that he has sent him money to get to England but he is unable to travel due to the restrictions as a result of the Easter Rising.</p>
