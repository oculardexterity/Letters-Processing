                            <p>This is a letter from Agnes Halton in the US to Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), British prime minister. Asquith, a Liberal MP, served as prime minister from 1908 until his resignation in December 1916. .  He was one of the longest continuously serving prime minister in the 20th century. In the letter, Halton states that she does not wish to be a traitor to her religion, but that the real allies to Germany are the Irish Catholic Clergy. She states that, if necessary she can provide names. Halton goes on to say that she wishes that the guilty are punished, but states that not all Irish are guilty, and that some are like John Redmond (1856-1918) and T. P. O&#39;Connor (1848-1929), Home Rulers. She warns that it must be followed up on as Irishmen will not betray their priest.</p>

1218 Arch St North Pittsburg U.S.A. April 28 1916 Mr Asquith Prime Minister Dear Sir At the expense of being considered a traitor to my church I must tell you that the real allies of the Germans and the ring leaders of this revolt are certain Irish Roman Catholic priests - I have been shocked at the hatred of England expressed by them. If necessary I can give names and occasions where these expressions have been made I assure you Sir that this is in no spirit of revenge nor for any gain except my love of England and my wish to see the guilty punished in Ireland for not all are guilty in Ireland for there are many as true as TP O'Connor or John Redmond himself. You may be inclined to ignore this warning coming from an unknown source but it is a clue and I implore you to heed it. I know the task is hard as the Irish are like the French

You may be inclined to ignore this<lb/>  warning coming from an unknown source but it is a<lb/>  clue and I implore you to heed it.
