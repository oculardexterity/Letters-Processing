                            <p>This is a letter from Eamonn O&#39;Modhráin (1881-1954) to his sister, Máire Ní Modhráin (1883-1964). O&#39;Modhráin had been arrested after the Easter Rising and imprisoned, spending time in Wakefield Prison and Frongach Internment Camp. This letter was sent while O&#39;Modhráin was in Frongach. Máire married Seamus O&#39;Connor, one of those who met at Wynn&#39;s Hotel in November 1913 when the Irish Volunteers was formed.  In the letter O&#39;Modhráin refers to letters and newspapers sent by family and his fellow Kildare prisoners and explains the rules for visits to the prison. He also requests clothes, newspapers and asks that his sister Tess send some more commemorative postcards of Thomas Clarke, one of the executed leaders of the Rising.</p>
