                            <p>This is a letter of condolence to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961). He acknowledges receipt of £5, for which 30 Gregorian Masses will be celebrated for the repose of The O&#39;Rahilly&#39;s soul. The monks prayed, on hearing of his death, that God would grant them all eternal rest and console their sorrowing friends.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death – the child was born three months later. Justin McCarthy was Abbot of Mount St. Joseph&#39;s Abbey, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary.</p>
