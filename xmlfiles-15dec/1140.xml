                            <p>This is a mobilisation order sent by William Pearse (1881-1916) to Seán Thomas O&#39;Kelly (1882-1966) on 21 April 1916.   The order is a personal order for O&#39;Kelly, signed by &#39;Acting Chief of Staff&#39; Willie Pearse, and was for the planned manoeuvres on Easter Sunday, 23 April. Unbeknownst to the rank and file, these manouevres were to be used as a cover for the beginning of the Easter Rising but were countermanded by Eoin MacNeill, chief of staff of the Irish Volunteers, when he became aware of the plans.

Dublin Brigade&#39; and instructs him on the equipment and rations he should bring.    William Pearse was a sculptor and brother of Patrick Pearse, one of the leaders of the Easter Rising. William held the rank of captain on the headquarters staff of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. O&#39;Kelly was a politician and later president of Irelan</p>
