                            <p>This letter was written by Fr Murnane on the eve of Roger Casement&#39;s execution. He describes how Casement is facing death bravely &#39;with the added courage and confidence of a good Catholic&#39;. Murnane describes Casement&#39;s message to all who supported him and writes that Casement has prayed for all those who tried to help him, in particular Mr. &amp; Mrs. Gavan Duffy. Fr.
