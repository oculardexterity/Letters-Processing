                            <p>This is a letter of condolence from Nancy Campbell to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer expresses sympathy with Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly family on the death of her &#39;heroic&#39; husband, mentioning the children and &#39;the child yet to be born&#39;. Campbell also writes about the honour of having known The O&#39;Rahilly and the other men who &#39;died for Ireland.&#39;    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later. </p>
