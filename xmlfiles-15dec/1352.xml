Wright explains that his maid was unable to reach Dublin due to the Easter Rising and had to return to London. He asks for compensation of £5 to reimburse money he has given to her to cover her outlay during this time.</p>

ROYAL NAVY BARRACKS CHATHAM 3rd May 1916 Sir I desire to bring to your notice the following, whereby, thanks to the non-announcement of the troubles in Dublin, I am out of pocket to the extent of some £5. On Monday 24th April I discharged an Irish maid-servant Violet Williams from Chatham to Dublin. She was unable to land in Ireland and having no friends or relatives outside Dublin, I cannot see that she could have acted otherwise than she did, which was to return to us when she found it impossible to reach her friends. This girl has no experience as a traveller and knows no one in England outside my own family. After many adventures she finally reached Kingstown, but was then advised to return to London as it was quite impossible for her to reach Dublin. What else could a young inexperienced girl, travelling alone do, under the circumstances especially as her stock of money was getting low? On arrival in London on Saturday morning she telephoned to me and rather than that she should be alone in London I told her to return to my house, where she arrived Saturday p.m. Her total expenses during this period (5 whole days) including journey from Chatham to Kingstown and back at single rates, food, cabs, porterage etc. and such sleeping accommodation as she could get, amounted to £5.1.6., and it was exceedingly fortunate that she carried enough money to meet the case, though she could not have gone on through another week end. Had the disturbed state of Dublin been announced I, of course would not have dreamed of letting the girl go, but under the circumstances, you will I am sure, agree that compensation is due to me for the amount mentioned as I have of course repaid the girl for what she spent over what I had allowed her for the actual journey. I have the honour to be, Sir Your obedient servant J. Smith-Wright Lieut-Commander R.N,  The Secretary Irish Office London S.W. <note>Acknowledge  MN5/5</note> <note>done <gap/> 5/5</note>

This girl has no experience as a traveller and  <lb/>knows no one in England outside my own family. After many adventures  <lb/>she finally reached Kingstown, but was then advised to return to  <lb/>London as it was quite impossible for her to reach Dublin. What  <lb/>else could a young inexperienced girl, travelling alone do, under  <lb/>the circumstances especially as her stock of money was getting low? <lb/>On arrival in London on Saturday morning she telephoned to me and  <lb/>rather than that she should be alone in London I told her to return  <lb/>to my house, where she arrived Saturday p.m.</p> <p>Her total expenses during this period (5 whole  <lb/>days) including journey from Chatham to Kingstown and back at single  <lb/>rates, food, cabs, porterage etc. and such sleeping accommodation <lb/>as she could get, amounted to £5.1.6., and it was exceedingly fortunate  <lb/>that she carried enough money to meet the case, though she could  <lb/>not have gone on through another week end.</p> <p>Had the disturbed state of Dublin been announced  <lb/>I, of course would not have dreamed of letting the girl go, but  <lb/>under the circumstances, you will I am sure, agree that  <lb/>compensation is due to me for the amount mentioned as I have of  <lb/>course repaid the girl for what she spent over what I had allowed <lb/> her for the actual journey.</p> <closer><salute>I have the honour to be, <lb/>Sir <lb/>Your obedient servant</salute> <signed><hi rend="underline">J.
