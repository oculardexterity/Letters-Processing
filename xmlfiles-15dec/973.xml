                            <p>This letter is from Máire de Buitléir (1873-1920)  It was sent to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly, (1875-1961). The writer expresses sympathy on the death of The O&#39;Rahilly and assures Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly of her prayers - she also prays for her own husband and she is sure that he and O&#39;Rahilly are in paradise together. The writer remarks on the high degree of respect there is for Mr. O&#39;Rahilly, even among those who didn&#39;t know him, didn&#39;t share his political outlook, and who &#39;disapproved entirely of the Rising&#39;.    Máire de Buitléir was a writer and Gaelic League activist, married to Tomás Ó Núalláin, (d.1914), Latin Professor and Irish scholar. Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914. She was the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916), who was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death – the child was born three months later.</p>

5 Warwick Terrace 24th May A Chara Dhilis It was so good of you to write. I know what an effort it must cost you & scarcely expected it. May God comfort you. You have been constantly in my thoughts & prayers. So has he been also, but I have a strong conviction he does not need our prayers - unless to increase his glory in Heaven. I believe we can help our beloved ones in that way. So I keep on praying always for my beloved husband, though I am sure he is in Paradise with yours.

<opener><address><addrLine>5 Warwick Terrace</addrLine></address> <dateline><date>24th May</date></dateline> <salute><foreign>A Chara Dhilis</foreign></salute></opener> <p>It was so good of you to write.  <lb/>I know what an effort it must  <lb/>cost you &amp; scarcely expected <lb/> it. May God comfort you. <lb/> You have been constantly <lb/> in my thoughts &amp; prayers.  <lb/>So has he been also, but I  <lb/>have a strong conviction he <lb/> does not need our prayers <lb/> - unless to increase his glory  <lb/>in Heaven. I believe we can  <lb/>help our beloved ones in <lb/> that way. So I keep on pray <lb/>-ing always for my beloved hus <lb/>band, though I am sure he <lb/> is in Paradise with yours.</p>

            <p>My sister - whose prayers are wasted <lb/> so much more than mine - is also  <lb/>praying much for you both. I have <lb/> told her all about it &amp; she is <lb/> deeply touched. It would com <lb/>-fort you a little if you heard the  <lb/>many words of esteem &amp; admir <lb/>-ation concerning your dear one <lb/> which I have heard during <lb/> the last few weeks, even from <lb/> those who had not the slightest  <lb/>sympathy with his political ideas,  <lb/>&amp; who disapproved entirely <lb/> of the Rising. <hi rend="underline">Everyone</hi> speaks <lb/> well of him. Everyone says <lb/> they know he acted from the  <lb/>highest motives, &amp; most  <lb/>bravely &amp; unselfishly &amp; chi- <lb/>-valrously. Dozens of people <lb/> who never met him have said <lb/> to me "I hear he was such <lb/> a good man - intensely religious

            <lb/>&amp; good in every way." And when people look at his <lb/> picture in the papers they say "What a good face  <lb/>he had." Everyone too feels for you the deepest  <lb/>sympathy. I am so glad to hear you are not  <lb/>suffering so much in body as you are in  <lb/>mind. I feared you would have been very ill. <lb/>I will call soon to inquire for you. You <lb/> must not trouble acknowledging this. <lb/>I enclose a few leaflets with some favour- <lb/>it thoughts of mind.
