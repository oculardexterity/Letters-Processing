                            <p>This is a letter to Eamonn O&#39;Modhráin (Edward Moran) (1881-1954) from a friend, Gus. O&#39;Modhráin had been arrested and imprisoned after the Easter Rising and spent time in Wakefield Prison and Frongach Internment Camp. This letter was sent while O&#39;Modhráin was in Wakefield. The author refers to a conversation with a prisoner recently released from Wakefield, friends held in other prisons and friends and family at home, including O&#39;Modhráin&#39;s brother Lewis, who had been released from Wakefield.</p>

            named Macken who has<lb/>  lately returned from<lb/>  your "college". He gave <lb/> me a good account<lb/>  of all the Rules and<lb/>  Regulations of your present<lb/>  abode. I am expecting <lb/> to see you back here any<lb/>  day but in case you<lb/>  don't arrive before <lb/> next week I intend<lb/>  going over to see you<pb/>

            I will probably leave Dublin<lb/>  Monday or Tuesday night 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi><lb/>  or 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Inst. In the meantime <lb/> if you want anything particularly<lb/>  write home to Ballysax as I<lb/>  will be there on Sunday (D.V.)<lb/>  and I can bring whatever you<lb/>  require. It is pleasant to know <lb/> that a good number of the<lb/>  restrictions placed on you at first<lb/>  have since been released. <del>Ben</del> <lb/> Eoghan O'Brien is in Stafford and<lb/>  his brother Peadar is in Knutsford.<lb/>  Their mother died last week (RIP)<lb/>  and they never knew a word about<lb/>  it. We are all well here. Lewis<lb/>  is coming to himself again. Best<lb/>  wishes hoping to see you soon</p> <closer><salute>Yours</salute></closer> Gus
