                            <p>This is a letter from a William Henry Caunt (b. 1879) of Cheshire to  Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), then Liberal Prime Minister of Great Britain. Caunt writes to complain about the low level of security on the Irish borders, which he sees as a threat to national security. Caunt claims he is writing as someone who was trapped in Dublin during the Rising during which stray shots posed a constant risk to one&#39;s life he feared the rebels. As a solution Caunt recommends that a house to house search should be carried out and conscription introduced in Ireland.     </p>

<addrLine>CHESIRE.</addrLine></address>   <dateline><date>May 4th. 1916</date></dateline> <salute>Sir,</salute></opener>  <p>I feel it my public duty to bring to your<lb/> notice the comparatively lax scrutiny which is being exercised<lb/> in the case of persons passing from as well as to Ireland, and which,<lb/>  from the point of view of national safety, I am convinced is<lb/> nothing like as thorough as the present state of affairs in<lb/>  Ireland demand. I speak as one of those luckless subjects of<lb/>  His Majesty who, until Monday evening last, was prevented from<lb/> leaving Dublin during Easter week owing to the ill-gotten purposes<lb/> of republican Irishmen, suffering much inconvenience, fright, and<lb/> constant risk of one's life from stray shots which flitted about<lb/>  from one side, than the other, and all the unexpected outcome of an<lb/> innocent visit for Easter Sunday and Monday. I do not complain<lb/>  so much of the scrutiny on the other side, xx xxxx as of the fact<lb/> that at Holyhead no person's landing from the Dublin S.S. Coy's<lb/>  Steamer "Munster" was challenged wither by a representative from<lb/> the Army, Navy, or Civic Police Authorities. Personally I expected<lb/>  the Kingstown examination was but a preliminary, and not a final<lb/> one. I can assure you, in the face of political assertions to the<lb/>  contrary from Irish M.P.s in parliament that the rebels have so <lb/> large a body of open and secret sympathisers as to demand the strict-<lb/> est scrutiny by the authorities at each port to and from Ireland. A<lb/>  house to house search here is imperative where arms and treason abound,<lb/>  and it would be interesting to know how many Alien or Sein Fein Clergy<lb/>  are presently enjoying liberty and immunity from suspicion. Why not<lb/>  after this, compel every Irishmen to do his bit who can be spared?</p>   <closer><salute>Yours faithfully,</salute> William Henry Caunt<lb/>  <address><addrLine>To the Right Hon:</addrLine>
