                            <p>  In this letter George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) tells Miss Blythe that he has visited her brother, Ernest Blythe, in Brixton Prison. He reports that Blythe is well, being well treated and that he does not know if he will be released.    George Gavan Duffy was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising.    Gavan Duffy had been acting for Ernest Blythe (1889-1975), organiser for the Irish Volunteers. Blythe had been arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act. He was released from prison in England before the Easter Rising but was rearrested there during Easter week 1916.</p>
