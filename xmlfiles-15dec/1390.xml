                            <p>This letter is from Kate English to her son Patrick. This letter was written by Kate shortly after she found out that Patrick had been sent to Wales. Kate immediately asks for all the details concerning when and for how long she can visit in addition to any items Patrick might like her to bring over. In the letter Kate reassures Patrick that she and all the family are well and look forward to his return.    This letter was written by Kate (b. 1855) to Patrick English (1894-1970) while he was interned. Patrick had been stationed in the G.P.O for the Rising. Following the surrender he was sent to Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales.    </p>
