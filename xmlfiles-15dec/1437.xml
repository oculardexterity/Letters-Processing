                            <p>This is a letter to Lewis Harcourt (1863-1922), Liberal politician, from Edward H. Andrews, the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. The letter acknowledges an enclosure regarding a resolution passed by the Council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. The enclosure states that the Council wish to express their loyalty to the king, It goes on to state that the rebellion of Easter 1916 would not have happened if not for the mismanagement of the Irish Government. It ends stating that all funds necessary to restore Dublin buildings should be provided. Although Harcourt is addressed as chief secretary of Ireland, he in fact never held the position.</p>
