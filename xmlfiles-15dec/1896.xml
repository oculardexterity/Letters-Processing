                            <p>Letter from Michael Collins (1890 - 1922) to Mary (Mollie) Woods, written from Stafford Prison. Collins writes of an impending transfer to &#39;the old camp&#39;, most likely Frongoch, and notes that, although the conditions are supposedly more unpleasant there, he shall be happy to be reunited with friends in the camp. Collins also warns of a rumour that prisoners will only be permitted to send one letter a week and so he may not be able to write to Woods for a time.     Michael Collins (1890-1922) served as aide-de-camp to Joseph Plunkett in the GPO during the Rising and was imprisoned in Frongach. He went on to become Minister for Finance in the First DÃ¡il, IRA Director of Information and President of the Provisional Government.    Mary (Mollie) Woods, wife to Andrew Woods, was an active member of Cumann na mBan after joining in 1916. Although Mollie did not participate in the Easter Rising the family were well connected within the Republican movement and actively participated in the War of Independence.</p>
