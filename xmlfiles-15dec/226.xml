                            <p>This letter, from James Ryan (1891–1970) to Liam Ó Brian (1888-1974) was sent from Stafford Detention Camp shortly before both men were transferred to Frongoch. In the letter, Ryan refers to Harry Nicholls [spelled &#39;Nichols&#39; in the letter] who, like Ó Briain had been unable to find his company and served under Mallin. The letter also refers to a number of others who were imprisoned after the Rising including Darrell Figgis and Seán T. O&#39;Kelly [&#39;Sean T&#39; in the letter] was a politician and later President of Ireland who was married to Ryan&#39;s sister Mary Kate.  &#39;Sean&#39; is Seán MacDiarmada, one of the signatories of the 1916 proclamation.

Ryan also refers to another sister, Agnes, in the letter.

<note>Liam O'Brien</note> J Ryan 750, Irish Prisoner, Stafford etc. June 1. 1916.  Dear Liam I wonder how are you going on over there. I suppose much the same as ourselves. You get concessions often I suppose, and are always hoping for the big concession of being allowed home. I believe Harry Nichols is there too invested in a red beard. You must be as black as the hob by this. I had two letters from the widow I am sure she wrote to you too. I suppose you heard all the news by this, as you are probably getting

I suppose much the <lb/> same as ourselves. You get concess <lb/>ions often I suppose, and are <lb/>always hoping for the big <lb/> concession of being allowed home.</p> <p>I believe Harry Nichols is there <lb/> too invested in a red beard. <lb/> You must be as black as <lb/> the hob by this. I had <lb/> two letters from the widow <lb/> I am sure she wrote to you <lb/> too. I suppose you heard <lb/> all the news by this, <lb/> as you are probably getting

            <lb/>all the newspapers like ourselves. <lb/> You know of course that Kit <lb/> and Nell are in Mountjoy <lb/> They will be released soon <lb/> I think. Sean T. is still <lb/> in Richmond. There is hardly <lb/> anybody here from Dublin that <lb/> you know I think. But <lb/> we have great company in <lb/> Paddy Keogh, Pim, &amp; <unclear>Darl</unclear> <lb/> Figgis, and T Treanor.</p> <p> I believe we are soon going <lb/> to be sent to Internment <lb/> Camps according to 16<hi rend="superscript">superscript text</hi> "Times".  <lb/> Perhaps we'll meet there. <lb/> I hope so any way. Tell <lb/> Paddy Doyle to be cheerful.</p>

            <p>We have now got great freedom here <lb/> and we won't feel the time passing. <lb/> I applied for release, as I only <lb/> tended the wounded; I don't know <lb/> what the result will be. Do you <lb/> ever hear a good story now? We <lb/> have not begun to tell them here <lb/> yet. I think there is rather <lb/> good material when we do begin. <lb/> Seán was in the best of form <lb/> up to the very last. Min and Phyllis <lb/> paid him a prolonged <lb/> visit on the last day. We <lb/> have a great crowd of Enniscorthy <lb/> fellows here. They <lb/> established it too I believe. <lb/> Fr Paul <add>(Walsh M.C.)</add> did a visit <lb/> the other day. He told us <lb/> a lot of news. I suppose you have had visitors too.

            <lb/>I am sending this letter through <lb/> Paddy Doyle, who is a great skin. <lb/> Be sure you give Harry my love. <lb/> There is going to be no Feis in <lb/> Wexford I believe. How many <lb/> of the old crowd would be <lb/> free to go? Only Power I <lb/> think. If you have any <lb/> news let us have it , if <lb/> not you may say a prayer <lb/> for me. I shall send your <lb/> love to the widow when I <lb/> am writing to her. Agnes is <lb/> at home at present, as you <lb/> might expect.</p> <p>No more news now. I must <lb/> go to the Rosary.</p> <signed>James Ryan</signed>
