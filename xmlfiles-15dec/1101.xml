<opener><dateline><date>Friday October 6 1916</date></dateline> <salute>A Tadg a chara,</salute></opener> <p>Your letter was very welcome  <lb/> indeed.  I can quite understand your reasons  <lb/> for not writing to anyone at this side. <lb/>I was very glad to hear that some of the  <lb/> January students are now in town. <lb/>I heard a lot about your Ballingeary  <lb/> doings through another source. <lb/>Tis very satisifactory that the Gaelic  <lb/> League is doing so well.  <del>T</del> Everybody  <lb/> here in good health.  O'L Tery and  <lb/> Arthur send remembrances to you.  I <unclear>covered</unclear>  <lb/> your suggestion re Arthurs work to just  <lb/> the thing.  I showed it to him and  <lb/> backed it up strongly myself.  He  <lb/> doesn't seem to be anxious to have it on  <lb/> <hi rend="underline">at present;</hi> others of course are  <lb/> already on the job and will only  <lb/> mess it.  As a matter of fact, I know  <lb/> one who is very near me at present  <lb/> who is collecting material for the work  <lb/> and has I believe a great share of it  <lb/> already done.  He has asked me for  <lb/> particulars which I have definitely  <lb/> refused to give.  The man is not capable

            of doing justice to the subject and  <lb/> will only spoil or hinder the work of  <lb/> a capable man.  Arthur is certainly  <lb/> the man for the job and I think that  <lb/> until he starts on it we should all be very careful  <lb/> of giving any details to others who will only  <lb/> create confusion, by lack of knowledge  <lb/> and mobility.  We have had quite  <lb/> enough of the "quack" always in this respect and we  <lb/> should now discourage it.  Let it be done  <lb/> by a <del>man</del> capable man.</p> <p>We were glad to hear of the election of the New Bishop but we  <lb/> didn't send him any congratulations  <lb/> for reasons which I daresay you  <lb/> understand.  Peadar did.</p> <p>Give my best wishes to all the  <lb/> boys you meet, write again at your  <lb/> convenience</p> <closer><salute>do cara</salute> <signed>Tomás</signed></closer>
