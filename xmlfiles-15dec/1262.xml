The author, a member of the Sherwood Foresters, believes that the watch was taken from Michael&#39;s body before his men could search him. This letter is part of a series of correspondence in which Miss O&#39;Rahilly is attempting to locate a watch belonging to Michael O&#39;Rahilly which was not returned to the family after his death.

2/6 Sherwood Foresters Rath Camp The Curragh Dear Miss O'Rahilly I apologise for not having replied to your letter before; I have been travelling all over Ireland, & your letter has been following me, & has always arrived too late. I am sorry to say that I cannot trace the watch & chain Etc.; I have made searching enquiries in my Company, but no one has them, & they say they have never seen them. I reported the matter to the Adjutant, & he told me I could offer your reward to any man who had it, but it was no use, & I certainly think that any soldier would give up anything he could get hold of if offered £10 for it.
