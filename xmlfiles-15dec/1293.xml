                            <p>This letter was written by  Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939).   In the letter Nathan is requesting that Chamberlain forward him reports concerning the whereabouts of every member of Chamberlain&#39;s staff in Dublin from the 22 April to 1 May. Nathan remarks that these accounts should be verified as far as it it is in Chamberlain&#39;s power to do so and added to with any comments Chamberlain sees fit.    Nathan was the under-secretary for Ireland from 1914 to 1916. In 1916 Nathan offered his resignation following the outbreak of the Easter Rising. The letter was addressed to the Inspector General, Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain (1856-1944). Chamberlain held the position from 1900 until his resignation in July 1916, making him the second longest serving inspector general in the force&#39;s history.</p>
