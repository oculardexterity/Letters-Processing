            <lb/>naturally, but I will  <lb/>write to you all the same <lb/> and when Michael is  <lb/>writing home if he says <lb/> how you are etc. his sister  <lb/>will let me know. She &amp; <lb/> I are great friends. I am  <lb/>expecting a letter from Liam  <lb/> I wonder he has not  <lb/>written. I don't know what  <lb/>are the rules of the camps, <lb/> &amp; are you allowed to <lb/> smoke? I wonder do you  <lb/>know a friend of mine  <lb/> Peter Moran only a day  <lb/>or two ago I found out  <lb/>that he had been in

            <lb/>Stafford. I thought he was  <lb/>in Wandsworth and asked  <lb/>Liam to look him up. He  <lb/>is now in Frongoch. The  <lb/>Councillor is laid up  <lb/>with influenza in Wandsworth  <lb/>but I suppose he will  <lb/>join you later on. It  <lb/>will be quite a <gap/>  <lb/>meeting for you all. I  <lb/>am glad your sister has  <lb/>been to see you, a visit  <lb/>from home must be a  <lb/>great treat to you at  <lb/>present. I want you to  <lb/>look up S. Donnelly <lb/> Wexford St. I don't know him <lb/> but his brother is a friend

            <lb/>of mine and some of them  <lb/>may be going over to Wales  <lb/>later on. If so I will get  <lb/>them to see my friends <lb/> also. I am told that you  <lb/>have the use of a piano  <lb/>in Camp &amp; that you have  <lb/>concerts amongst yourselves  <lb/>Is it true I wonder. If  <lb/>it is ask Peter Moran to  <lb/>sing a few ?comic? songs  <lb/>for you.
