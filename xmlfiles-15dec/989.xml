                            <p>This is a letter of condolence to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer expresses deepest sympathy and says that The O&#39;Rahilly&#39;s name is a household word in his area. He assures her that &#39;that spot in Moore St.&#39; (where her husband died) will be a place of pilgrimage for generations to come.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916). The O&#39;Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.</p>
