                            <p>This letter is from Kate English to her son Patrick. In the letter Kate observes that Patrick has not been released while many of his comrades have. She also discusses attending mass with her daughter Nellie and prays that when he returns home they will attend together. She also inquires as to whether he received a letter sent by Robert Driscoll.    This letter was written by Kate (b. 1855) to Patrick English (1894-1970) while he was interned. Patrick had been stationed in the G.P.O for the Rising. Following the surrender he was sent to Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales.</p>
