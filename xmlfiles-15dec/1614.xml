                            <p>This is a letter from Thomas Wallace Russell, to the under-secretary. In the letter Russell is writing regarding the court martial and sentencing of an employee of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for his part in the 1916 Rising.     The employees name was John Shouldice (b. 1881). Shouldice was a member of the Irish Volunteers and took part in the fighting in the Church Street area in Dublin during Easter Week 1916. Following the Rising Shouldice was arrested and imprisoned. He would go on to later play an active role during the War of Independence.    Russell (b. 1841) is writing as vice-president of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction. The letter is addressed to the under-secretary, which at this time is Sir Robert Chalmers (1858-1938). Chalmers was sent to Ireland as under-secretary, replacing Sir Matthew Nathan who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell, his chief secretary following the Easter Rising in 1916. </p>
