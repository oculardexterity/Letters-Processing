                            <p>This letter was written by a group of Irish prisoners in Frongoch to Timothy Healy. In this letter the prisoners quote a letter previously read to them which remitted the punishment of prisoners for refusing to preform fatigue duty.The letter also refers to a hunger strike, in protest of such punishment, that has since ceased.      Frongoch Internment Camp in Wales was a makeshift prison used for the internment of approximately 1,800 Irishmen in the wake of the Easter Rising, 1916. It was to become known as the &#39;University of Revolution&#39; because of the revolutionary nature of the inmates.    Timothy Michael &#39;Tim&#39; Healy (1855â€“1931) was an Irish journalist, author, barrister and an Irish Parliamentary Party MP. He was one of the few King&#39;s Counsel who represented Irish prisoners detained at Frongoch Internment Camp after the Easter Rising in 1916.  Among the signatories to this letter are Michael Staines, Thomas Sinnott and Richard Mulcahy.    Staines (1885 - 1955) was a member of the Irish Republican Brother</p>

T.M. Healy., Esq., K.C.,M.P. 10th Oct 1916.  Sir,  This morning about 10.30 a.m. the Camp Leaders were brought before the Commandant and the following letter read to them:-  Home Office,  Whitehall. 9th Oct. 11916  313106 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that he has had under his consideration the case of the prisoners now under punishment for refusing to perform <unclear>fatigue</unclear> duty ordered by you (removal of rubbish from the Guard's quarters) and it appears to him that they have now been sufficiently punished for this offence. He has therefore decided to remit the remainder of the punishment and also for the future to relieve them from this particular duty, which he understands from you, can be properly performed by the Guard.  In announcing this decision to the prisoners the Secretary of State desires that you should make it clear that in his opinion you were right in requiring them to perform this duty and right in punishing those who refused, but the matter being a trifling one he does not desire to carry the matter further.  I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd) M.L. Waller.  The Commandant, Prisoners of War Camp, Frongoch.

As a result of the above letter all the prisoners confined in the North Camp are being brought back to-day, except the eight prisoners whose case has been dealt with in Paras. dated 4th and 5th Oct. of our previous letter to you dated Frongoch 8th Oct.  We have only quite recently heard that two other prisoners (H. Wilson and M. Kent) who were of the above fatigueparty, were also undergoing a hunger strike in the North Camp since last Thursday, they contending that the stoppage of their letters was also inflicting a punishment on their people at home.

<opener><dateline><date>10th Oct 1916.</date></dateline>  <salute>Sir,</salute></opener>  <p>This morning about 10.30 a.m. the Camp Leaders were<lb/>  brought before the Commandant and the following letter read<lb/>  to them:-</p>  <address>Home Office,<lb/>  Whitehall.</address> <date>9th Oct. 11916</date>  313106<lb/> Sir,<lb/> <p>I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that<lb/>  he has had under his consideration the case of the prisoners<lb/>  now under punishment for refusing to perform <unclear>fatigue</unclear> duty<lb/>  ordered by you (removal of rubbish from the Guard's quarters)<lb/>  and it appears to him that they have now been sufficiently<lb/>  punished for this offence. He has therefore decided to remit<lb/>  the remainder of the punishment and also for the future to<lb/>  relieve them from this particular duty, which he understands<lb/>  from you, can be properly performed by the Guard.</p>  <p>In announcing this decision to the prisoners the<lb/>  Secretary of State desires that you should make it clear that<lb/>  in his opinion you were right in <hi rend="superscript">requiring them to perform this duty and right in</hi> punishing those who refused,<lb/> but the matter being a trifling one he does not desire to<lb/>  carry the matter further.</p>  <salute>I am, Sir,<lb/> Your obedient servant,</salute> (Sgd) M.L. Waller.<lb/>  <address>The Commandant,<lb/> Prisoners of War Camp,<lb/> Frongoch.</address>

            <address>As a result of the above letter all the prisoners<lb/>  confined in the North Camp are being brought back to-day,<lb/>  except the eight prisoners whose case has been dealt with<lb/>  in Paras. dated 4th and 5th Oct. of our previous letter to<lb/>  you dated Frongoch 8th Oct.</address>  <p>We have only quite recently heard that two other<lb/>  prisoners (H. Wilson and M. Kent) who were of the above<lb/>  fatigueparty, were also undergoing a hunger strike in the <lb/> North Camp since last Thursday, they contending that the<lb/>  stoppage of their letters was also inflicting a punishment<lb/>  on their people at home. In deference to the earnest wishes <lb/> of the Catholic Chaplain here these two prisoners above mentioned<lb/>  consented to take their meals this morning.</p> <closer><salute>We desire to remain, Sir, <lb/> Your Obedient Servants,</salute></closer> M.S.
