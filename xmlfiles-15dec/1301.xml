                            <p>This is a letter from Sister M. Marcella to Anna O&#39;Rahilly, the sister of Michael  Joseph O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916) The letter discusses two of Anna&#39;s pupils and their success in their exams, most notably Irish. The letter goes on to discuss the death of Anna&#39;s brother Michael. It also discusses Nancy, Michael&#39;s wife, stating that the author prays for her daily.     Michael &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916) was a nationalist and a journalist. In 1916 he aligned himself with Eoin MacNeill (1867-1945) and Bulmer Hobson (1883-1969) who opposed a preemptive rising. Although O&#39;Rahilly played a large role in delivering MacNeill&#39;s countermanding order he felt obligated to stand with the men he recruited and trained. O&#39;Rahilly was fatally wounded on Thursday 27 April when the GPO was being evacuated.</p>
