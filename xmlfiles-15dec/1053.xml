                            <p>This is a letter from Herbert Moore Pim (1883-1950) to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer describes receiving news of The O&#39;Rahilly&#39;s death as a nightmare - he hopes everything will be all right on waking. He loved O&#39;Rahilly as a dear friend. He and his son want to convey sympathy to &#39;the boys&#39; (Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly&#39;s sons). He himself was taken away while his son was at school and didn&#39;t have a chance to say goodbye. He also describes prison life.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan aand the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-styled as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916), who was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death.     Herbert Pim had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914, published a pamphlet series entitled &#39;Tracts of our times&#39;, including writing by Patrick Pearse, and in early 1916 founded the literary and political monthly, &#39;The Irishman&#39;.  He was arrested after the Easter Rising </p>
