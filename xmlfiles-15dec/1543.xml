                            <p>This letter was written by Michael O&#39;Flanagan (b. 1883), a Catholic priest in the Boyle parish in Co. Roscommon. The letter was addressed to Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929). Alice Stopford Green was the wife of historian John Richard Green (1837-1883). Stopford Green was a nationalist, involved in the Howth gun-running and a historian in her own right. She was shocked by the 1916 rising and horrified that Casement had been plotting to obtain German assistance. Nonetheless, she visited Casement in prison and lobbied hard to prevent his execution.  In the letter O&#39;Flanagan remarks that he is enclosing testimonials signed by the people of his half parish. O&#39;Flanagan notes how unifying Casement&#39;s reprieve campaign is and that the people have never co-operated so much before. O&#39;Flanagan mentions that himself and other were not satisfied with the &#39;quasi apology&#39; issued by the British government for the execution of the Irish Volunteers, men who he believes were martyrs and heroes.</p>

Crosna, Boyle, July 30th 1916. My dear Mrs Green, I enclose testimonial signed by the people of this half parish. I never saw the people so unanimous before.

The leaders of the two factions never cooperated in anything before, but this time they vied with each other in procuring signatures.

<addrLine>, Boyle,</addrLine></address> <dateline><date>July 30th 1916</date></dateline>. <salute>My dear Mrs Green,</salute></opener> <p>I enclose testimonial<lb/>  signed by the people of this<lb/>  half parish. I never saw<lb/>  the people so unanimous<lb/>  before. We have two old<lb/>  factions here, as they have<lb/>  I suppose in most places. <lb/> The leaders of the two factions<lb/>  never cooperated in anything<lb/>  before, but this time they vied<lb/>  with each other in procuring signatures.</p>  <p> Some of us do not like<lb/>  the quasi apology for the<lb/>  execution of the Irish<lb/>  Volunteer Leaders, insinuated<pb/>

            in the fourth paragraph<lb/>  but we are willing to<lb/>  waive that point for the<lb/>  purpose of doing our part<lb/>  for Roger Casement. The men<lb/>  who were executed in Dublin<lb/>  are to us martyrs &amp; heroes,<lb/>  &amp; the Government that<lb/>  ordered their execution<lb/>  are guilty of a great crime.<lb/>  We know that Roger Casement<lb/>  would gladly join the glorious<lb/>  band of those who have given<lb/>  their lives for Ireland.</p>  <p> But not all of us hold these<lb/>  views. One thing we are<lb/>  all agreed upon, &amp; that is<lb/>  the desire that Roger Casement<lb/>  should not be executed.</p> <closer><salute>Yours faithfully</salute></closer> M.O'Flanagan C.C.
