                            <p>An acquaintance of the writer&#39;s brother, anonymous and unknown to Madeleine, upon hearing of the death of &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly, sends a cheque, asking that a draft for the same amount be sent to Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly - the donor only wanting to be identified as &#39;a sympathiser&#39;.    Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-described as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly, (1875-1916) was involved in the procurement of arms in the lead-up to the Rising and was involved in the Howth gun-running incident. He fought in the G.P.O. During the Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961), his wife, was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.</p>
