                            <p>In this letter, Colonel F.M. Taylor rebuts Thomas Kelly&#39;s (1868-1942) claims for military compensation. Kelly writes that the officer in charge of the unit that occupied his building during Easter week took all his papers away, including his personal sketchbooks.      Thomas Kelly was an influential member of the Dublin City Council in the early decades of the 20th century. His achievements included replacing slums with social housing; developing a public library service; and the foundation of the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art. Although not involved in fighting during the rising, he was arrested afterwards but was released after a short time. He was arrested again in 1919 and was unable to take his position as Lord Mayor of Dublin due to health complications that had arisen from his imprisonment.</p>
