                            <p>This is a letter from S.M. Martina to Nancy O&#39;Rahilly  (1875-1961). The writer apologises for not writing sooner, saying that, as a stranger, she didn&#39;t want to intrude too early on Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly&#39;s grief. She praises The O&#39;Rahilly and and says that the sisters have been offering prayers. She mentions &#39;the boys&#39; and hopes they will be a comfort. Finally the writer requests a supply of mortuary cards and offers deepest sympathy. In a P.S. she invites Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly to visit the Convent.    Nancy O&#39;Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at its founding in 1914. She was the wife of Michael Joseph O&#39;Rahilly, self-styled as &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1916), who was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband&#39;s death â€“ the child was born three months later.  </p>
