                            <p>This letter was written by E. F. Batty to the under-secretary of Ireland. In this letter Batty argues in favour of arming the police force of Dublin, and handing over control of that force to the government for the duration of the war, in light of the recent events of Easter Week. Batty believes that this move would maintain law and order in Dublin while also restoring confidence.       The letter is addressed to the under-secretary, which at this time is Sir Robert Chalmers (1858-1938). Chalmers was sent to Ireland as under-secretary, replacing Sir Matthew Nathan who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell, his chief secretary following the Easter Rising in 1916.</p>
