                            <p>This letter was written by Fr James O’Shea (1873 – 1927), to General John Grenfell Maxwell (1859 – 1929).  This letter concerns the conduct of Fr Michael Hayes (1873 – 1934), and Fr Thomas Wall (1877 – 1956). According to the letter Maxwell considers both Hayes and Wall a dangerous menace to the peace and safety of the realm. In the letter O&#39;Shea reports that the bishop of Limerick, Edward Thomas O&#39;Dwyer (1842-1917), has been made aware of the complaints but has no right to punish the priests in question except on definite charge supported with evidence.     Maxwell had been appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising. He arrived in Ireland on Friday 28 April, the fifth day of the insurrection. As acting military governor of Ireland, Maxwell dealt with the rebellion according to his understanding of martial law which had been earlier declared by the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
