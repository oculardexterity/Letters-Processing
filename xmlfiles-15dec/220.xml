NOTE IN TOP LEFT CORNER : I see Máirín has a parcel of tobacco here for you so I'll send mine elsewhere. K. 82 Grove Park, My dear Jim, Its about time I started to write to you isn't it? To tell the truth what has kept me back is lack of moral courage to ask permission. You know writing to an engaged young man is a rather delicate matter & one must set very rigid limits to all expressions of emotion. Dare I say now I miss you? I don't know, I may be led away by my feelings & find myself in the midst of a most compromising declaration. In case I do you can think like Mother Eucharia that 'these student introductions are not recognized in society' - sicut - I'm sure she added. We were all delighted to hear you are doing somewhat better than you seemed to be at first. I hope you aren't one of the ferocious characters who are kept in solitary confinement. A show ought to be started special attractions 'Rare Specimens of an almost extinct species only found in some parts of Ireland'. I'm sure the prison authorities would make a good thing if they charged all you ordinary people 6 to

to see these strange dangerous specimens of Irish. Funny we don't come across them here isn't it. Perhaps its the English air affects them & develops cannabalistic tendencies. There is great news here - Kit is being released or I suppose I should say has been released. She got out at 8.30 this morning, herself & three others. There was to be a great demonstration for her I believe. We of course couldn't get to it. The university people will be delighted. Poor Nell is still dangerous. Kit was easily tamed evidently. I believe Miss Browne of Wexford and Miss ffrench Mullin are getting out too, but I'm sure you will have later news from home. They'll write to tell you about Kit. ?Shaw? is still in Rathfarnham , & is bearing up well under the disgrace of being connected with such a family. I expect we'll see Kit this evg. but I'll leave the description of the meeting to Mairín. She being nearly one of the family will do it better than an outsider.

Some of the last 200 deportees have gone to Stafford I see. They are divided over Wandsworth, Knutsford & Wakefield. I went to Richmond for the 1st time last Thurs. We could never get at visiting hours of course. We saw Seán T. ?Dinny?, Pierce McCann the Connollys, T. McSweeney, Mal de Mer, Gearóid O'S & several others. They told us a crowd was going off that night, so we all went down the quays on spec. We thought we'd only get waving from a distance, but we terrified the soldiers for they let us walk down beside the prisoners & we talked to them all down the quays. The first I saw were P. McCann and little Mal de Mer. Do you remember him foxtrotting at the dances? I walked? in the line of soldiers till I got shoved out. Then I went back & came on Seán T. spick & span as usual with ?my?, overcoat & evening paper. I got in with himself & ffrench Mullin & nearly got deported myself. They were all in great form except Garóid O'S who was at the far side of rank & looked afraid nobody

Pierce Mc & Dinny are gone to Knutsford. They will be alright there as the Manchester people are swarming down I believe with hampers. In Wandsworth they have a great colony, Liam ÓB Cole, Seán T.

whatever his name is. I must write to him soon. Will he mind being written to by people he doesn't know. I feel great pity for the country fellows who have nobody to write to them and to give them a send-off. Forgot to tell you we gave the boys a great send-off on Thurs. They all sang seditious songs all along the route. It was grand to think they couldn't be stopped singing.  We were out at a Mass for the Pearses yesterday in Rathfarnham. The place was packed. We have ?????? a ????? ????? & got two, ????? to go to Mass yesterday. Margaret says the Countess takes very kindly to the Catholic religion but she can't get over the 5th & 6th commandments. Perhaps you could give some tips from you new Theology. You ought to be starting it now. I'm sure the revision of the Bible is complete. Have you got any books to read? What kind do you like. I'm afraid of sending things you have read before, but I suppose you could give them to others even if they didn't appeal

to see these strange dangerous specimens of Irish. Funny we don't come across them here isn't it. Perhaps its the English air affects them & develops cannabalistic tendencies. There is great news here - Kit is being released or I suppose I should say has been released. She got out at 8.30 this morning, herself & three others. There was to be a great demonstration for her I believe. We of course couldn't get to it. The university people will be delighted. Poor Nell is still dangerous. Kit was easily tamed evidently. I believe Miss Browne of Wexford and Miss ffrench Mullin are getting out too, but I'm sure you will have later news from home. They'll write to tell you about Kit. ?Stan? is still in Rathfarnham , & is bearing up well under the disgrace of being connected with such a family.

You know writing to<lb/>  an engaged young man is a rather delicate matter &amp; one<lb/> must set very rigid limits to all expressions of emotion.<lb/>  Dare I say now I miss you? I don't know, I may be led<lb/>  away by my feelings &amp; find myself in the midst of a<lb/>  most compromising declaration. In case I do you can<lb/>  think like Mother Eucharia that 'these student<lb/>  introductions are not recognized in society' &#x2014;<sic>sicut</sic> &#x2014;<lb/>  I'm sure she added. We were all delighted to hear<lb/>  you are doing somewhat better than you seemed to be<lb/>  at first. I hope you aren't one of the ferocious<lb/>  characters who are kept in solitary confinement.<lb/>  A show ought to be started special attractions<lb/>  'Rare Specimens of an almost extinct species<lb/>  only found in some parts of Ireland'. I'm<lb/>  sure the prison authorities would make a good<lb/>  thing if they charged all you ordinary people 6 to<pb/>

            to see these <del>exotics</del> strange dangerous specimens of Irish.<lb/>  Funny we don't come across them here isn't it. Perhaps<lb/>  its the English air affects them &amp; develops<lb/>  cannabalistic tendencies.</p> <p>There is great news here &#x2014; Kit is being released<lb/>  or I suppose I should say has been released.<lb/>  She got out at 8.30 this morning, herself &amp; three<lb/>  others. There was to be a great demonstration<lb/>  for her I believe. We of course couldn't get<lb/>  to it. The university people will be delighted.<lb/>  Poor Nell is still <del>a</del> dangerous. Kit was<lb/>  easily tamed evidently. I believe Miss Browne<lb/>  of Wexford and Miss Ffrench Mullin are getting<lb/>  out too, but I'm sure you will have later news<lb/>  from home. They'll write to tell you about<lb/>  Kit. Stan is still in Rathfarnham , &amp; is bearing<lb/>  up well under the disgrace of being connected<lb/>  with such a family. I expect we'll see Kit<lb/>  this evg. but I'll leave the description of the<lb/>  meeting to Mairín. She being nearly one of the<lb/>  family will do it better than an outsider.</p><pb/>

            <p>None of the last 200 deportees have gone to Stafford I see.<lb/>  They are divided over Wandsworth, Knutsford &amp;<lb/>  Wakefield. I went to Richmond for the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> time<lb/>  last Thurs. We could never get at visiting hours<lb/>  of course. We saw Seán T. Dinny, Pierce McCann<lb/>  the Connollys, T. McSweeney, Mal de Mer, Gearóid O'S<lb/>  &amp; several others. They told us a crowd was going<lb/>  off that night, so we all went down the quays on<lb/>  spec. We thought we'd only get waving from a<lb/>  distance, but we terrified the soldiers for they<lb/>  let us walk down beside the prisoners &amp;<lb/>  we talked to them all down the quays. The first<lb/>  I saw were P. McCann and little Mal de Mer. Do you<lb/> remember him foxtrotting at the dances? I walked <lb/>  in the line of soldiers till I got shoved out.<lb/>  Then I went back &amp; came on Seán T. spick<lb/>  &amp; span as usual with rug, overcoat &amp; evening<lb/>  paper. I got in with himself &amp; ffrench Mullin<lb/>  &amp; nearly got deported myself.

            would see him. Terence McS. was in great form &amp;<lb/>  rushed out of his place to ask us to get up a camp<lb/>  near Wakefield for the summer. So you may be watching<lb/>  out for a caravan doing the rounds of the prisons.<lb/>  Pierce Mc &amp; Dinny are gone to Knutsford. They will<lb/> be all right there as the Manchester people are<lb/>  swarming down I believe with hampers.</p> <p>In Wandsworth they have a great colony, Liam ÓB<lb/>  Cole, Seán T. Garóid, Ginger &amp; ffrench Mullin. We had<lb/>  a great letter from Liam on Sat. He has a beard<lb/>  which he says will put even Harry Nicholls<lb/>  to the blush (though Harry's is red I believe,<del>)</del><lb/>  naturally). He was accusing the English of greater<lb/>  atrocities in Ireland than the Germans had<lb/>  inflicted on Belgium. He represented to the<lb/>  officer in charge that no cruelty could equal<lb/>  in refinement that undergone by Irishwomen<lb/>  in being deprived of the consolation of his<lb/> (Liam's) presence <del>)</del> But the unfeeling brute only<lb/>  laughed. In Wandsworth they are allowed to<lb/>   talk for several hours every day. I suppose you<lb/>  are too. Is there anyone with you but <unclear>Power</unclear> or <pb/>

            whatever his name is. I must write to him soon. Will he<lb/>  mind being written to by people he doesn't know. I feel<lb/>  great pity for the country fellows who have nobody<lb/>  to write to them &amp; <unclear>to</unclear> give them a send off. I forgot<lb/>  to tell you we gave the boys a great send off <lb/> on Thurs. They all sang seditious songs<lb/>  all along the route. It was grand to think they<lb/>  couldn't be stopped singing.</p> <p>We were out at a Mass for the Pearses yesterday in<lb/>  Rathfarnham. The place was packed. We have<lb/>  <gap/> a <gap/> &amp; got two, <gap/><lb/>  to go to Mass yesterday. Margaret says the Countess<lb/>  takes very kindly to the Catholic religion but she<lb/>  can't get over the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> commandments. Perhaps<lb/>  you could give some tips from your new Theology.<lb/>  You ought to be starting it now. I'm sure the<lb/>  revision of the Bible is complete. Have you<lb/>  got any books to read? What kind do you<lb/>  like. I'm afraid of sending things you have<lb/>  read before, but I suppose you could<lb/>  give them to others even if they didn't appeal <pb/>

            to yourself, so I must begin to collect. What about<lb/>  notepaper &amp; pencils. Would they be useful? Send<lb/>  word to any of us &amp; we'll send on anything you<lb/>  want yourself or anything you could give<lb/>   other fellows who are not in the fortunate<lb/>  position of having a crowd of female<lb/>  admirers. I'm sending on a few cigarettes<lb/>  &amp; a little tobacco. I suppose that is always<lb/>  welcome &amp; let us know about anything else.<lb/> I suppose Mairín has told you Neeson is in<lb/>  Sussex. She <gap/>letters from<lb/> him, but no news. Philosophical treatises<lb/>  would be a fit setting for his correspondence.<lb/>  I can't think of anything more to say so I'll<lb/>  wind up. Just I forgot we are setting up a picnic<lb/>  for the relief fund 2/6 for <sic>ticketes</sic> 1/ for <hi rend="underline">extras</hi><lb/>  on a graduated scale 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> for holding hands<lb/>  &amp; so on. Could you give suggestions as to what<lb/>  sort of thing we should charge extra for.<lb/>  Love from the four angels as Liam calls us to self<lb/>  Doreen &amp; all the other Bearded Brigade.</p> <closer><salute>Yrs.
