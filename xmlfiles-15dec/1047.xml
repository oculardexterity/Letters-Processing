                            <p>This is a letter from Cis M Coyle to James Ryan (1891-1970)  on 11 July 1916. This letter was written while Ryan was a prisoner in Frongach in Wales. She refers mainly to mutual friends at home and fellow prisoners of Ryan&#39;s.    James Ryan studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna FÃ¡il and a government minister.    </p>
