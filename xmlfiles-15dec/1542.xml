                            <p>This letter was written by M. J. O&#39;Donnell, a member of Kerry County Council. The letter is addresed to Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929). Alice Stopford Green was the wife of historian John Richard Green (1837-1883). Stopford Green was a nationalist, involved in the Howth gun-running and a historian in her own right. She was shocked by the 1916 Rising and horrified that Casement had been plotting to obtain German assistance. Nonetheless, she visited Casement in prison and lobbied to prevent his execution.  In the letter O&#39;Donnell refers to a petition signed by &#39;nine of the most representative men&#39; in his parish.   The petition concerns the case of Roger Casement (1864-1916). Casement had been imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. A campaign was launched featuring many prominent figures such as W.B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw to secure a reprieve for Casement but he was hanged on 3 August 1916.In the letter O&#39;Donne</p>

Castlegregory. Co. Kerry. July 28th 1916. Madam, I send herewith the Casement petition signed by nine of the most representative men in this parish. I personally endorse every word in the petition and I hope and pray that the members of the Government will see their way to spare the life of this <del>deleted text</del> pure souled honourable Irish gentleman. I may mention that the Kerry County Council, at its quarterly meeting yesterday, at which I presided, unanimously passed a strong resolution calling for clemency for Roger Casement. Anyway, another chapter shall have to be added to "Irish Nationality", and I fear me that the last sentence in the last chapter of the same shall have to be rewritten. I have the honour to be, Madam, a humble admirer of the great work you have done for Ireland "In Memory of the Irish Dead". M. j. O'Donnell, J.P. M.C.C. Madam J.R. Green, 36 Grosvenor Rd. Westminster.
