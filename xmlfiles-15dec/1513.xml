                            <p>This letter is from Mary O&#39;Nolan, address 5 Warwick Terrace, Leeson Park, Dublin to Alice Stopford Green, (1847-1929), historian, nationalist and friend of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). Mary O&#39;Nolan is busily campaigning for Roger Casement, attempting to have his death sentence commuted. Casement had been arrested on Banna Strand on the eve of the Easter Rising and tried for treason. She mentions the king, the US government, John Redmond and Colonel Moore in Buswells Hotel.</p>

<opener><address><addrLine>5 Warwick Terrace Leeson Park</addrLine>
<addrLine>Dublin</addrLine></address><dateline><date>25th July</date></dateline>  <salute>Dear Mrs. Green</salute></opener> <p>We are shocked to see the date fixed for  <lb/>the execution. Still we do not give up hope, <lb/>&amp; are working still hard for reprieve.  <lb/>I enclose copy of letter sent by  <lb/>our Reprieve Com. to the King today.  <lb/>Also copy of cablegram to Botha. <lb/>Could you also petition King to  <lb/>exercise prerogative of mercy,  <lb/>&amp; could you get at Botha &amp;   <lb/>other Colonial premiers? Is U.S. Government  <lb/> doing nothing? I see mass  <lb/>petitions are being sent in by  <lb/>A.O.H. &amp; other Irish American bodies,  <lb/>but will the U.S. Government <gap/> move?  <lb/>These horrible slanders on our  <lb/> friend have injured our prospects  <lb/>of success.
