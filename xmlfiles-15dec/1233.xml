                            <p>This is a letter to Mary Ellen (‘Nell’) O’Rahilly concerning the death of her brother Micheal.  The author of this letter expresses her sympathy for Nell and Michael&#39;s family but notes that this is what he would have wanted. While expressing sympathy for the plight of Ireland&#39;s men the writer acknowledges that it is the wives, mothers and sister of those men who suffer most. The author then requests that Nell send on &#39;relics&#39; of Michael and any other photographs, that she can lay her hands on, of the leaders of the Rising.     Michael Joseph &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875–1916) was a nationalist and a journalist. In 1916 he aligned himself with Eoin MacNeill and Bulmer Hobson who opposed a preemptive rising. Although O&#39;Rahilly played a large role in delivering MacNeill&#39;s countermanding order he felt obligated to stand with the men he recruited and trained. O&#39;Rahilly was fatally wounded on the Thursday 27 April when the GPO was being evacuated.     Nell was also involved in the Nationalist movement as a member </p>
