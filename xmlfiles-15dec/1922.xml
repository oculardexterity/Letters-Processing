                            <p>An incomplete letter from an Irish Volunteer of the Kimmage Garrison, to &#39;Ag&#39; giving a dramatic account of events during the first two days (Monday and Tuesday) of the 1916 Easter Rising. The letter seems to be written soon after the event. The Volunteer describes the failed attack by British lancers of the 6th Cavalry, a shoot out on O&#39;Connell bridge, the looting of Sackville Street and the live and let live attitude between the Volunteers and members of the RIC.    The Kimmage Garrison was set up by Joseph Mary Plunkett and George Oliver Plunkett, at Larkfield House, Kimmage.  The property was used by the Volunteers as a weapons store, explosives factory, training base, and quarters for enlistees returning from overseas.</p>
