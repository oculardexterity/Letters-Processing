                            <p>This is a covering letter from the Casement Relief Petition sent to Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), British prime minister, from the Casement Relief Petition Committee. They are sending 46 signatures to be included with the petitions they have already sent by the same post. But, because these people are not &#39;people of note&#39; they are to be understood as a different category. Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) had been arrested at Banna Strand, County Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. Though Casement had not been intimately involved in the planning of the Easter Rising and had travelled to Ireland from Germany to try and prevent it taking place, believing it should not happen without sufficient German support, he had been sentenced to sentenced to death for treason.  The names of the relief committee, who were campaigning for a reprieve, are listed in full.</p>
