                            <p>This is Vane&#39;s reply to a letter of 3 October from the War Office.  He understands that, despite his record as a recruiting officer in Ireland and various positive comments and commendations from senior officers, he is &#39;no longer an officer&#39;. He feels that his reporting of the murders of Sheehy-Skeffington, Dixon, and McIntyre, and his refusal to condone them, and his efforts to &#39;allay the feeling of anger&#39; in Ireland, was beneficial to the reputation of the army and of H.M Government.He asks for an explanation from the Army Council of &#39;the reasons which led them to relegate me to unemployment&#39; in view of the many commendations he received.    Major Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher-Vane (1861-1934) was in command of Portobello Barracks during the Easter Rising. When he learned about activities of Captain J.C.

<note>Copy of reply to War Office letter 3rd, Oct, 1916. <lb/>29004/22 (C.I.)  <opener><address><addrLine>National Liberal Club</addrLine>
<addrLine>S.W.</addrLine></address> <dateline><date>5th October, 1916.</date></dateline> <note>Sir Reginald Brade K.C.B. War Office</note> <salute>Sir,</salute></opener> <p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your <lb/> letter dated 3rd inst.</p> <p>I am, therefore, to understand that I am at present  <lb/>"no longer an officer", in spite of the fact that for an  <lb/>action on the 27th April last, I was recommended for distin- <lb/>guished service in the field in command of men by the Briga- <lb/>dier, who was present.  Moreover, for the command of the <lb/> Defences, Portobello Barracks, during the week of the Rising,  <lb/>I was personally commended and thanked for this work and for <lb/> the reorganisation of these posts, by the Officer Commanding <lb/> the Troops.</p> <p>I beg to call the attention of the Army Council further <lb/> to the fact that in reporting the murders of Messrs. Skeffing- <lb/>ton, Dickson, and McIntyre, and refusing to condone these <lb/> murders, I performed valuable service for the Honour of the  <lb/>Army and for the reputation of H. M's Government in Ireland. <lb/> This personal report of mine was carried through correctly. <lb/> On the 1st May, six days after the illegal shootings, having <lb/> remonstrated with the then Commanding Officer for placing <lb/> Captain Bowen Colthurst in command of the Defences, he at the <lb/> time being under accusation of murder, I proceeded in due se- <lb/>quence to report to the Irish Command, Park Gate.  There <lb/> receiving no assurance that the latter officer was to be placed  <lb/>under restraint, I proceeded to London and reported the facts <lb/> to the Rt. Hon<hi rend="superscript">ble</hi> H. J. Tennant, late Parliamentary Secretary, <lb/> W. O., (2nd May) and to the late Earl Kitchener, (3rd May).   <lb/>Mr Tennant in writing thanked me for this action, and Lord

            <lb/>Kitchener, in the presence of Mr Bonham Carter, stated that  <lb/>I had acted quite rightly.  Lord Kitchener in my presence <lb/> dictated the telegram ordering Captain Bowen Colthurst to be <lb/> placed under arrest, which in fact was not carried out until <lb/> the 6th May - exactly ten days after the crimes had been com- <lb/>mitted.</p> <p>At the time of the occurrence of the Rebellion I was <lb/> engaged in recruiting in Ireland, and at once volunteered my <lb/> services for the suppression of the Rising.  I was gazetted  <lb/>on the 31st March and posted by Garrison Order for duty during  <lb/>the Rebellion 24th April.</p> <p>May I point out that nothing has occurred to show that <lb/> I failed in my duty as a recruiting officer and on the con- <lb/>trary so far as efficency in that work is concerned, it may <lb/> be noted that at my own expense I raised 500 recruits in <lb/> London between 24th August and 5th Sept., 1914.  In addition <lb/> there are the above reports proving my efficiency in the field.</p> <p>It is well known throughout Ireland that I did not  <lb/>spare myself in attempting to allay the feeling of anger which <lb/> had arisen when the facts of the murders became known, by ren- <lb/>dering every assistance in my power to the widow of the mur- <lb/>dered man, and by making it known widely that the crimes were  <lb/>unauthorised.</p> <p>In these circumstances I must, therefore, ask you to  <lb/>convey to the Army Council my desire for an explanation of the <lb/> reasons which led them to relegate me to unemployment on the <lb/> 30th June, seeing that then I had only recently performed <lb/> duties which earned me the recommendation of a Brigadier,  <lb/>of strong commendation of the Officer Commanding at Portobel- <lb/>lo Barracks and the thanks of Lord Kitchener, of Mr. Tennant, <lb/> and of the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister.</p> <closer><salute>I have the honour to be,  <lb/>Sir,  <lb/>Your obedient servant,</salute></closer>  <lb/>Captain, late Major R.M.F.
