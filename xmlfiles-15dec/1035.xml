                            <p>This letter is from Nancy O&#39;Rahilly (1875-1961) to Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). Nancy O&#39;Rahilly writes says she hasn&#39;t been seeing people or answering letters because it upsets her and she is concerned for her unborn child and tries to reassure Mrs. FitzGerald saying that the prisoners (Desmond included) would be released at the end of the war. Mrs. O&#39;Rahilly says that Desmond FitzGerald left his top coat at her house and she says that she has also heard about the bicycle being left in Milltown* and that she is having it collected.
