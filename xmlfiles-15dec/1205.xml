                            <p>Letter from William John Rundle (b.1865) to Mr. Campbell. The letter contains the details of Rundle&#39;s whereabouts from Saturday 22 April to 1 May, the weekend prior to, and the week in which, the Easter Rising took place. Rundle states he spent most of his time at his private address or on patrol. Rundle&#39;s record of patrol was given to his local Officer Training Corp unit. The corp, nicknamed the &#39;Gorgeous Wrecks&#39; owing to the &#39;Georgious Rex&#39; badges they wore and their advanced age, were a voluntary training militia.    The Georgeous Rex volunteers suffered several casualties, including the death of IRFU president Francis Browning (1868-1916), during the fighting at Mount Street Bridge. Irish Volunteers stationed at 25 Northumberland Road fired upon them as they returned from training exercises in the Wicklow mountains.    </p>
