                            <p>This letter was written by James McFadden Brown (b.1879), a clerk at the Royal Irish Constabulary office, to the inspector general. The letter is Brown&#39;s reply to the Chief Secretary of Ireland, Augustine Birrell (1850-1933), requiring information about Brown&#39;s whereabouts from 24 April to 1 May 1916. Brown states that he attempted to report to the office after hearing that Dublin Castle had been taken by the rebels.    The letter was addressed to Inspector General Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain (1856-1944). Chamberlain held the position from 1900 until his resignation in July 1916, making him the second longest serving inspector general in the force&#39;s history.  </p>
