                            <p>This is a letter from Charles John Hyde (b. 1862), the manager of W &amp; A Gilbey Ltd. to Matthew Nathan (1862-1939), Undersecretary for Ireland. Mathew Nathan had become undersecretary in 1914 under Augustine Birrell (1850â€“1933). After the Easter Rising 1916, Nathan resigned as undersecretary due to his misjudgement and failure to stop the Rising. The letter states that Hyde received a letter from Lord Blythe (d. 1925) the director of W &amp; A Gilbey Ltd, a wine importers and distillers. The letter stated that he offered the government room in the company for postal services due to the disturbance of the Easter Rising. </p>
