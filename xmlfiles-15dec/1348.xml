                            <p>This is a letter from Thomas B. Garvey, a member of the Board of Guardians Council, to Robert Chalmers (1858-1938), the under-secretary of Ireland. It discusses a Board of Guardians meeting held in Kerry, enclosing a cutting regarding the meeting. Garvey writes that he made a resolution for the board to condemn the actions of the rebels during the 1916 Rising, and that all but one person supported the resolution. Garvey goes on to write that Michael Keating, a man he describes as an extreme Sinn Feiner, proposed to rescind the resolution. When an objection was made by Garvey turmoil and disorder ensued.     Robert Chalmers became under-secretary for a brief period following the resignation of Matthew Nathan (1862-1939), who relinquished his position due to his administration&#39;s failure to contain the 1916 Rising. </p>

Bridge Street Caherciveen 3/6/16  To the Right Honourable Sir R Chalmers Under - Secretary Dublin Castle  Sir Referring to my letter of 31st ult, I beg to submit for your information a cutting from the Killarney Echo of 20th ult., containing a report of the proceedings of the Board of Guardians and District Council of 17th ult. There were fifteen Councillors present on the occasion, and a resolution which I proposed condemning the recent rebellion in Dublin was passed with one dissenting voice. A notice to rescind that resolution on that day a fortnight was handed in by Councillor Michael Keating who is an extreme Sinn Feiner. He is a small farmer, and he has five nieces teaching schools under the National Board. I also enclose a cutting from the Killarney Echo of this date giving a report of the proceedings of the Council on 31st ult. Mr Keating's motion to rescind my resolution was carried by 7 votes to 3. There were eleven Councillors present at that meeting. One did not vote. A number of the Councillors who were present at the meeting of the 17th ult., were I have been informed , threatened by the Sinn Fein members not to attend. When I got up to move the rejection of Mr Keating's motion the Sinn Fein members created an unprecedented scene of tumult and disorder.The outburst was apparently premeditated. I am Sir Your Obedient Servant, T.B. Garvey R.I.C. (note illegible)

He <lb/> is I understand, a native of County <lb/> Clare. He is a sound, healthy, vigorous <lb/> man and apparently fit for military <lb/> service.

E. DEVLIN, Asst. Sec.</p> <lb/><p>Mr. John A. O'Sullivan &#x2014; The  <lb/>people of Valentia want a doctor.  There  <lb/>is no other doctor to take up the posi-  <lb/>tion but the applicant. He is em-  <lb/>ployed by the Valentia Cable Company  <lb/>and is the soldiers' doctor in Valentia.  <lb/>I propose that Dr. T. O'Driscoll be  <lb/>appointed.</p> <lb/><p>Mr. Walsh &#x2014; I second it.</p> <lb/><p>Mr. John P. O'Sullivan &#x2014; The Val- <lb/>entia people want a doctor as well as <lb/>any other people.</p> <lb/><p>The proposition was adopted.</p> <lb/><p>Dr. O'Driscoll returned thanks.</p> <lb/>A Letter. <lb/><p>The Clerk read the following: &#x2014; <lb/>Local Government Board, <lb/>Dublin, 16th May, 1916. <lb/>Sir, &#x2014; I am directed by the local Go- <lb/>vernment Board for Ireland to for- <lb/>ward to be laid before the Board of  <lb/> Guardians of Caherciveen Union, the  <lb/> accompanying copy of a communication  <lb/> which they have received from Mr. T.  <lb/> Garvey, P.L.G relating to a man  <lb/> named Callaghan, an inmate of the  <lb/> Workhouse, and I am to request that  <lb/> the Board may be furnished with the  <lb/> observations of the Guardians thereon.  <lb/> &#x2014; I am, sir, your obedient servant, <lb/> A. R. BARLAS</p>  <lb/> The transmitted Letter.  <lb/> Caherciveen, 29th April, 1916.  <lb/> To the Secretary, L. G. B.  <lb/> Dublin  <lb/> <p>Sir, &#x2014;  An order for the <unclear>discharge</unclear> of  <lb/> an able-bodied pauper named John Cal- <lb/>laghan was made by the Guardians  <lb/> here in 1914, but he was re-admitted  <lb/> shortly afterwards without their autho <lb/>rity.  It is quite manifest that the  <lb/> Master took upon himself this respon <lb/>sibility, and if he is allowed to usurp  <lb/> powers which he does not possess, dis <lb/>cipline cannot be maintained. Callag <lb/>han is not a native of this Union. He  <lb/> is I understand, a native of County  <lb/> Clare. He is a sound, healthy, vig- <lb/>porous man, and apparently fit for mili- <lb/>tary service. It is nothing short of a  <lb/> scandal to keep a man of this class in  <lb/>  the Workhouse at the expense of the  <lb/> ratepayers. He is a painter by trade  <lb/> and could at present earn from £2 to  <!-- Third Column --> <lb/>£3 per week in England or Scotland.</p>  <lb/> <p>A discussion took place on this  <lb/> matter at the meeting of the Guard- <lb/>ians held at Caherciveen on the 19th  <lb/> inst., but no order was made. The  <lb/> Master admitted that Callaghan is  <lb/> very useful to him in the way of brush <lb/>ing his rooms, cooking his food, and  <lb/> painting. I am not aware that the  <lb/> Local Government Board or the Guard <lb/>ians have made any provision for pro- <lb/>curing a butler for the Master. This  <lb/> certainly is an innovation in Work-  <lb/> house administration. Please bring  <lb/> this report under the notice of A. P. <lb/> Delaney. Esq. Local Government Board  <lb/> Inspector, so that he may deal with  <lb/> the matter on his  next inspection. I  <lb/> enclose a cutting from the Killarney  <lb/> Echo of the <unclear>29th</unclear> inst. giving parti- <lb/>culars of the discussion on the 19th  <lb/> inst. by the Guardians in reference to  <lb/> Callaghan. &#x2014; Yours faithfully  <lb/> T. GARVEY P. L. G.</p>   <lb/> <p>Mr. McCarthy &#x2014; The Workhouse  <lb/> Master says he is very useful.</p>  <lb/> <p>Master &#x2014; He is not a very healthy  <lb/> man, <sic>an</sic> his sight is weak. He does a  <lb/> good deal of painting in the house. <lb/> He is not my butler, but he is useful</p>  <lb/> <p>Mr Garvey &#x2014; He was discharged</p>  <lb/> <p>Master &#x2014; He was discharged in my  <lb/> absence  while I was on leave.</p> <lb/> <p>Mr Garvey &#x2014; I know you were on <lb/> leave at the time.</p>  <lb/> <p>Mr John A. O' Sullivan &#x2014; He was dis- <lb/>charged and it was at my proposition  <lb/> he was kept the last day, and Mr  <lb/> Garvey did not object.</p>  <lb/> <p>Mr Garvey &#x2014; The minutes of the  <lb/> meeting in June, 1914, will show the  <lb/> order of his discharge from the Work- <lb/>house.</p> <lb/> <p>Mr. John A. O'Sullivan &#x2014; Is an inmate  <lb/> of the workhouse supposed to attend or  <lb/> do business for the officers of the Work- <lb/>house?</p>  <lb/> <p>Clerk &#x2014; There is no such arrangement  <lb/> made that the inmates should be re- <lb/>quired  to do work for the officers of the  <lb/>house.</p> <lb/> <p>After some further discussion it was  <lb/> agreed to allow Callaghan in the house  <lb/> Mr Garvey dissenting.</p> <lb/> THE RECENT INSURRECTION  <lb/> <p>Mr Garvey proposed the following re- <lb/>solution "That we express our horror and  <lb/> <gap/> of the Sinn Fein rebellion in  <lb/> Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland, and  <lb/> view with indignation the appalling loss  <lb/> of life and destruction of valuable pro <lb/>perty.  That we renew implicit confidence  <lb/> in the constitutional policy of Mr John  <lb/>E.  Redmond and the Irish Party. That</p>
