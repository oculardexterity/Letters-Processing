                            <p>This letter was written by Lieutenant Colonel R.L. Owens to Anna O&#39;Rahilly. In this letter Owens informs Miss O&#39;Rahilly that he has been in communication with the commanding officer at Moore Street and that he has no information regarding the missing articles which Miss O&#39;Rahilly is searching for. He states that the company of his battalion was relieved at 5:30 pm Saturday 29 April by a company of the 26th Notts and Derby Regiment. This letter is part of a series of correspondence in which Miss O&#39;Rahilly is attempting to locate a watch belonging to Michael O&#39;Rahilly which was not returned to the family after his death.     Owens was a Lieutenant Colonel at Richmond Barracks and served over the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment. This was one of the regiments involved in helping to defeat the Rising in 1916.     Anna O&#39;Rahilly was the sister of Michael O&#39;Rahilly. Michael Joseph &#39;The&#39; O&#39;Rahilly (1875â€“1916) was a nationalist and a journalist. In 1916 he aligned himself with Eoin MacNeill and Bulmer Hobs</p>
