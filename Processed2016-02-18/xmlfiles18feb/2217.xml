                            <p>Letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his mother. James writes about waiting for deliveries of parcels and his concern that his letters home are not being delivered. As per his previous letter, he stresses his need for replacement boots and requests that any items of kit be sent as soon as possible. He also mentions the conditions of the trenches and considerable shelling and fighting in nearby sections.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute></opener>  &#x2014; I got your
<lb/> letter of 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>  yest &amp; was surprised
<lb/> to hear that you had not received
<lb/> any letters from me since
<lb/> 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.  I wrote on 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> &amp; 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> then to 
<lb/>Father on 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; again to you
<lb/> on 16t<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>.  I do hope you have
<lb/> since received them as I am
<lb/> now very badly off for boots
<lb/> &amp; looking anxiously every day
<lb/> for those trench books to turn
<lb/> up.  The boots I had have
<lb/> simply gone to pieces with the
<lb/> trench work &amp; my feet are
<lb/> always wet.  With regard to
<lb/> the pair of boots which you say have arrived from Manfields
<lb/> I cant remember whether I
<lb/> ordered them or not but at
<lb/> any rate they have come just

            <lb/>at the right time &amp; you might
<lb/> please have them also sent on
<lb/> as soon as possible.  I
<lb/> think I asked you to post me
<lb/> a box of  <unclear>Cockles</unclear> pills &#x2014; these have
<lb/> not come yet so if by chance
<lb/> they have been overlooked would
<lb/>you please get them for me.
<lb/> There was a terrific bombardment
<lb/> this evening to the left of our
<lb/> Sector &#x2014; it was like continuous
<lb/> thunder &amp; the flashes of the guns
<lb/> lit up the whole sky.  Our
<lb/> particular part of the the line has
<lb/> been rather more peaceful during
<lb/> the past day or so but one of 
<lb/>my gun teams had a great 
<lb/>escape.  We had been annoying
<lb/> the Germans considerably the 
<lb/>night before with 2 guns so
<lb/> they started to look for us
<lb/> with artillery &amp; actually dropped

            <lb/>2 shells right on top of the
<lb/> emplacement where the men 
<lb/>were taking shelter.  Fortunately
<lb/> it had a concrete roof &amp; the 
<lb/>shell  did not penetrate for
<lb/> otherwise everyone would have
<lb/> been killed &amp; they were all
<lb/> men of my own original section.
<lb/>  Am kept awfully busy &#x2014; never
<lb/> seem to have a minute &#x2014; but
<lb/> have been keeping all right in
<lb/> spite of the weather.  Trenches
<lb/> have been flooded &amp; yest I
<lb/> was wading all morning up to nearly
<lb/> the knees &amp; with my ordinary old
<lb/> boots so you can imagine what 
<lb/>a state I was in.  Must be off
<lb/> to bed.  With fondest love to all.
