                            <p>A letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his mother. James writes about the fighting and conditions in the trenches and his hope for leave within the next month as he feels he is in need of rest. He also requests that she order replacement items of kit to be sent to him.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

My dearest Mother&#x2014; Have not<lb/>
had time to write for the past<lb/>
few days &#x2014; I can never get<lb/>
through half the things that I<lb/>
feel should be done.  Was glad<lb/>
to get K's letter &amp; to hear that all<lb/>
goes on well at home.  Sorry<lb/>
about poor old Mrs MacIlwaine<lb/>
I suppose it was her old heart<lb/>
trouble.   We have been having<lb/>
awful weather here &#x2014; rain &amp;<lb/>
storm.   The trenches are in a <lb/>
terrible state &#x2014; one sinks into<lb/>
mud &amp;almost sticks in it.<lb/>
My boots are in a bad way so<lb/>
hope you were able to have my<lb/>
special branch boots sent off.<lb/>
&amp; that they will arrive soon.<lb/>
Would you please order another<lb/>
pair of the ordinary heavy Army<lb/>

<p>My dearest Mother&#x2014; Have not
had time to write for the past
few days &#x2014; I can never get
through half the things that I
feel should be done.  Was glad
to get K's letter &amp; to hear that all
goes on well at home.  Sorry
about poor old Mrs MacIlwaine
I suppose it was her old heart
trouble.   We have been having
awful weather here &#x2014; rain &amp;
storm.   The trenches are in a 
terrible state &#x2014; one sinks into
mud &amp;almost sticks in it.
My boots are in a bad way so
hope you were able to have my
special branch boots sent off.
&amp; that they will arrive soon.
Would you please order another
pair of the ordinary heavy Army

            pattern from Manfield same
exactly as the last pair only
with nails in the soles.
These can be sent out also as
soon as ready.  <del>W</del> We have
not been shelled quite so much
during the last 3 days which is
rather a relief.   One of my gun
teams had a great escape day
before yest.  A shell dropped plump
on the direction post of the gun
just 25 yds away but did not
burst.  On Sat last the Germans
were particularly vicious.  When
I was leaving my advanced H Q
with the battery that has just been
returned they put a shell on either
side of the road unpleasantly close
however a miss is just as good
as a mile &amp; so far my <unclear>Comp</unclear> has
had great luck.  If things
go well &amp; there is not much

            doing I hope to be able to arrange
to get leave early in March about
5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> but of course will let
you know more definitely later.
Have been keeping wonderfully
well but feel badly in need of
a rest.   With fondest love
to all
