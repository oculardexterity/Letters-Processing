The letter also refers to the assistance Dalton provided in helping a man named Moses O'Connor receive a passport for travel to Canada.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION
7th August, 1916.
Dear Mr. Wright, 
I am sorry to trouble you again about the papers relative to the late Crawford Neill. Mr. O'Connor sent me, a few weeks ago, copies of the statements made in the case, but Mr. Lyster, the Librarian of the National Library, is very anxious to get the <hi rend="underline">original</hi>papers if possible.
If, therefore, there be no official objection to the return of these documents now we should be very glad if you could let us have them back.
I wrote you from Malahide about a man named Moses O'Connor who was waiting for a passport to Canada. The passport came next day. I am sure you must have helped expedite the matter, and I am much obliged for the trouble taken in the case.
Yours very faithfully,
William Dalton

R.H. Wright, Esq.,
Registrar,
Chief Secretary's Office.
<note>Asst. Under Secretary. I see no objection to the return of the 3 documents asked for by Mr. Lyster on behalf of the late Mr. Neil's relatives. Do you approve? WMC 8/8/16 </note>

<salute>Dear Mr. Wright</salute></opener>, 
<p>I am sorry to trouble you again about the papers
<lb/> relative to the late Crawford Neill. Mr. O'Connor sent
<lb/> me, a few weeks ago, copies of the statements made in the
<lb/> case, but Mr. Lyster, the Librarian of the National Library,
<lb/> is very anxious to get the <hi rend="underline">original</hi>papers if possible.
<lb/>If, therefore, there be no official objection to the return
<lb/> of these documents now we should be very glad if you could
<lb/> let us have them back.</p>
<p>I wrote you from Malahide about a man named Moses
<lb/> O'Connor who was waiting for a passport to Canada. The 
<lb/>passport came next day. I am sure you must have helped to
<lb/>expedite the matter, and I am much obliged for the trouble 
<lb/>taken in the case.</p>
<salute>Yours very faithfully,</salute>
<signed>William Dalton</signed>

<address>R.H. Wright, Esq.,
<lb/>Registrar,
<lb/>Chief Secretary's Office.</address>

<note>3 originals returned to Mr. Dalton accordingly</note>

<note>Asst. Under Secretary.
<lb/> I see no objection to the return of
<lb/> the 3 documents asked for by Mr. Lyster on 
<lb/>behalf of the late Mr. Neil's relatives. Do you approve? 
<lb/>WMC <date>8/8/16</date> </note>
