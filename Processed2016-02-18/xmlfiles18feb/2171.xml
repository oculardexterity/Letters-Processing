                            <p>Letter from William Montgomery to his father, Harford Hugh (1856-1933). Montgomery thanks his father for food that he sent. This letter provides details of his time as second in command and the prospect of his becoming a lieutenant colonel. He gives a detailed account of his position in the army and his achievements.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>The Montgomery family lived in Malone Park, one of the wealthiest suburbs of Belfast city. This letter is part of a large collection that their son, William, a Captain with the 9th Battalion of the Royal Irish Rifles, wrote to his parents, Harford Hugh and Sara Montgomery, throughout the war. His first letter is dated 3 December 1914. Captain Montgomery was a decorated soldier. He was awarded both the Victoria and the 15 Star medals and was promoted to the rank of Major. His father owned a fire assessor business.</p>

<p>Yes. I would love that<lb/><lb/> salvage amusement. I fear for a<lb/> year or two after this thing finishes<lb/> I shall miss the movement and<lb/> excitement of it terribly</p>
<p>No sign of Horace yet. There<lb/> would appear to be some considerable<lb/> delay in the arrival of his relief where<lb/> he is now. We are all at a loss to<lb/> understand what has caused this<lb/> delay as almost a month ago we got<lb/> official <unclear>information</unclear> to the effect that<lb/> he would be with us quite soon.</p>

I find myself in command of the<lb/> Battalion. About 4oc.p.m. the C.O. got a<lb/> wire telling him to take over command<lb/> of a Brigade. He didn't know where it was,<lb/> who they are, or anything but he left<lb/> here to take them over at <hi rend="underline">5.35</hi>p.m.</p>
<p>Mother would think it a frightful<lb/> rush. Some career in this war<lb/> he has already had. Captain to<lb/> Temporary Brigadier General in two<lb/> years &amp; a month. He told me before<lb/> he left that he would send for me<lb/> just as soon as he finds a good job<lb/> for me - preferably a staff job.</p>
<p>Our Adjutant has also had a career<lb/> in this war - Thro' Mons as <hi rend="underline">a Corporal<lb/> in the Grenadier Guards</hi>, also Aisne on<lb/> the Marne wounded, got his Commission<lb/> posted 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Lieut East Lancs. attached to<lb/> us as <unclear>2/Lt</unclear>. &amp; Adjutant promoted Lieut<lb/> then Captain &amp; Adjutant &amp; now he will<lb/> probably follow the C.O. as brigade<lb/> Major.

<p>The much more gratifying part<lb/> of the business to both you &amp; me is<lb/> undoubtedly the fact that a very<lb/> pukka regular Brigadier is satisfied<lb/> to leave me responsible for a Battalion<lb/> front in the line.

<lb/> I get a few of the best cigars, either

<p>Do you remember those spurs you

l<lb/> the first day I wore them, one of

<salute>My Dear Father/</salute></opener>
<p>I have to acknowledge
<lb/> your very interesting letter of 11<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> inst
<lb/> also to convey my thanks for the
<lb/> bread and two pots of lemon cheese
<lb/> which <hi rend="underline">did</hi>turn up quite all right.
<lb/> A little more stale than you would
<lb/>touch at home, but one afternoon
<lb/> tea just absolutely finished the
<lb/> whole bag of tricks <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> including
<lb/> the paper wrappings.</p>
<p>Yes. I would love that
<lb/> salvage amusement. I fear for a
<lb/> year or two after this thing finishes
<lb/> I shall miss the movement and
<lb/> excitement of it terribly</p>
<p>No sign of Horace yet. There
<lb/> would appear to be some considerable
<lb/> delay in the arrival of his relief where
<lb/> he is now. We are all at a loss to
<lb/> understand what has caused this
<lb/> delay as almost a month ago we got
<lb/> official <unclear>information</unclear> to the effect that
<lb/> he would be with us quite soon.</p>
<p>Today, like other days, I of
<lb/> course expect Horace to arrive &amp; I go
<lb/> back to command my Coy. but instead

            <lb/>I find myself in command of the
<lb/> Battalion. About 4oc.p.m. the C.O. got a
<lb/> wire telling him to take over command
<lb/> of a Brigade. He didn't know where it was,
<lb/> who they are, or anything but he left
<lb/> here to take them over at <hi rend="underline">5.35</hi>p.m.</p>
<p>Mother would think it a frightful
<lb/> rush. Some career in this war
<lb/> he has already had. Captain to
<lb/> Temporary Brigadier General in two
<lb/> years &amp; a month. He told me before
<lb/> he left that he would send for me
<lb/> just as soon as he finds a good job
<lb/> for me - preferably a staff job.</p>
<p>Our Adjutant has also had a career
<lb/> in this war - Thro' Mons as <hi rend="underline">a Corporal
<lb/> in the Grenadier Guards</hi>, also Aisne on
<lb/> the Marne wounded, got his Commission
<lb/> posted 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Lieut East Lancs. attached to
<lb/> us as 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> &amp; Adjutant promoted Lieut
<lb/> then Captain &amp; Adjutant &amp; now he will
<lb/> probably follow the C.O. as brigade
<lb/> Major. Before this thing finishes
<lb/> there will be some extraordinary
<lb/> records of service. For instance, my
<lb/> own in its way is odd enough</p>
<p>I have been wearing a major's crown
<lb/> for about a week now, because I
        
    
         
        <pb n="5598" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5598"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>have been performing the duties of 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>
<lb/> in Command of a Batt for upwards of 30
<lb/> days. I will also continue to draw pay as
<lb/> such until some one senior to me joins
<lb/> when I revert to my rank as Captain.
<lb/> Again, if by any chance, I am left in
<lb/> command of the Batt. for 30 days I will
<lb/> be given permission to put up a
<lb/> star in addition &amp; become for all
<lb/> practical purposes a Lieut. Colonel.
<lb/> Extraordinary when one thinks of it?</p>
<p>The responsibility is, of course, heavy
<lb/> but I am glad to say it does not now
<lb/> &amp; never has worried me in the very
<lb/> slightest. Settling a £50 loss has often
<lb/> caused me a lot more worry &amp; I didn't
<lb/> do it as well. Some little time ago I was
<lb/> officially approached to see if I would
<lb/> take a permanent commission, but
<lb/> I said most definitely &amp; finally - NO I
<lb/> would hate it in peace time anyway
<lb/> apart altogether from all the other
<lb/> impossibilities. If by any chance I
<lb/> happened to get knocked out whilst I
<lb/> wear the crown as Major Montgomery
<lb/> (as I just now find myself) Emmie would
<lb/> draw a Major's pension. It is a
<lb/> great war &amp; as my old namesake
<lb/> foreman used to say "You never know
        
    
         
        <pb n="5599" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5599"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>the minute". Please don't address my
<lb/> letters as "Major". It is quite correct
<lb/> to do so&amp; all that &amp; I sign my name
<lb/> as such but I don't care about it
<lb/> until such time as it may in the
<lb/> future appear in the Gazette.</p>
<p>The much more gratifying part
<lb/> of the business to both you &amp; me is
<lb/> undoubtedly the fact that a very
<lb/> pukka regular Brigadier is satisfied
<lb/> to leave me responsible for a Battalion
<lb/> front in the line. It all goes down
<lb/> on an official document known as
<lb/> my record of service &amp;  I don't lose by
<lb/> it in the end, even if I do revert to
<lb/> Captain again for a bit. From what
<lb/> Brigadier General F.P. Crozier said to me
<lb/> just before he left, it won't be for long
<lb/> if he can help it. I have some good
<lb/> friends at court here apart altogether
<lb/> from my late C.O. No more Coy.
<lb/> cmdg. for me if I can possibly
<lb/> avoid it. I have 13 months of it to
<lb/> my credit &amp; I like my present
<lb/> temporary job - <hi rend="underline">no, my this morning's
 <lb/>temporary job</hi> much better.  I also
<lb/> have a great curiosity to do a bit of
<lb/> the staff end of the game. In fact
<lb/> if it lasts as long as I think it will
        
    
         
        <pb n="5600" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5600"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>the sooner I start the Staff side the
<lb/> better for me. Don't bother about
<lb/> a fountain pen nib for me thanks
<lb/> I rather fancy a pal of mine in
<lb/> town intends to send me a whole 
<lb/>complete pen.</p>
<p>This game presents extraordinary
<lb/> contrasts conditions &amp; circumstances.
<lb/> I was just thinking of this tonight
<lb/> at dinner &amp; comparing our present
<lb/> circumstances with those which
<lb/> prevailed with us last winter. As I
<lb/> sit commanding a Batt in the line tonight
<lb/> I am not at all certain that I am
<lb/> not quite as comfortable as you are.</p>
<p>Counting a Doctor, a Chaplain &amp; an
<lb/> Artillery <sic>Liason</sic> Officer we set down
<lb/> 11 to dinner - <hi rend="underline">my</hi> H.Q. mess. We had
<lb/> excellent soup. Beautiful Fresh sole,
<lb/> very good roast beef &amp; Yorkshire
<lb/> pudding, , stewed figs &amp; custard, Coffee.
<lb/> <sic>Savories</sic> we cut out some ten
<lb/> days ago because we could only
<lb/> manage 4 kinds &amp; we are tired
<lb/> of those for a bit. To drink we have
<lb/> a coice of anyhting one likes.
<lb/> The only thing there is any
<lb/> difficulty about is liqueurs. I
<lb/> Personally drink the best of good
        
    
         
        <pb n="5601" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5601"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>Guinness Stout &amp; every now &amp; then
<lb/> I get a few of the best cigars, either
<lb/> given me or bought by me when
<lb/> I dine out in style. You will
<lb/> think it ridiculous, I know, but
<lb/> nevertheless the men love their
<lb/> officers to have good sticks &amp; whips
<lb/> &amp; spurs &amp; <unclear>kit</unclear> &amp; to smoke good stuff.</p>
<p>Do you remember those spurs you
<lb/> were good enough to send me. Wel
l<lb/> the first day I wore them, one of
<lb/> my sergeants, accompanied by
<lb/> a sergeant of another unit came
<lb/> to my temporary home &amp; asked me
<lb/> to settle a bet. It appeared he had bet
<lb/> the other fellow they were silver. I
<lb/> was sorry to disappoint him, but
<lb/> that is the point &amp; the spirit. And
<lb/> no one can even dimly estimate
<lb/> its value when it comes to
<lb/> leading &amp; obedience in face of
<lb/> the last thing in grim hellishness.</p>
<p>No one knows just what little
<lb/> thing one does or says to a man or
<lb/> men which makes them yours in
<lb/> all things when the big times come.</p>
<p>I know of several cases where
<lb/> this has undoubtedly been so.</p>
<p>Our men are also just as
        
    
         
        <pb n="5602" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5602"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>comfortable as constant thought
<lb/> &amp; unremitting labour can make
<lb/> them. It is however necessary that
<lb/> officers are maintained <hi rend="underline">very</hi> comfortable
<lb/> in order that they can be at their
<lb/> best to do the best either for their
<lb/> men or in the use of them.</p>
<p>The old "share the hardships of
<lb/> their men idea" which is so truly
<lb/> British is still with us but
<lb/> modified. The Bosch started this
<lb/> war so very much more scientifically
<lb/> than we did &amp; this was one of his
<lb/> great points.</p>
<p>I dont suppose you get time for
<lb/> much reading, but if you do &amp; you
<lb/> care to read a really human
<lb/> readable history of this war get
<lb/> the Strand Magazine. It is
<lb/> excellent &amp; your son knows
<lb/> almost every little rise &amp; fall of
<lb/> ground &amp; line of much of the line
<lb/> that is there written of.</p>
<p>It will give you a faint
<lb/> impression of what our original
<lb/> Expeditionary Force did &amp; was. No
<lb/> one can really know just what
<lb/> it was except those who were
<lb/> through the first 6 months of it.</p>
        
    
         
        <pb n="5603" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5603"/>
        
        
           
            <p>But perhaps with your old Puritan
<lb/> Blood <add>you</add> wont care about it. Still
<lb/> as effort alone it stands as
<lb/> colossal. I am convinced now
<lb/> that the end is certain &amp; that we
<lb/> will be the senior survivors. If
<lb/> it is protracted as long as I think
<lb/> it will be, the expression 'WIN' will
<lb/> not be accurately applicable in its
<lb/> popular sense. I forgot in
<lb/> describing our mess to mention that
<lb/> some of my young officers are
<lb/> now playing Ping pong whilst one
<lb/> with whom we dined is prowling
<lb/> about NO MANS LAND on patrol &amp; 
<lb/>others are inspecting the line &amp;
<lb/> sentries &amp; guns etc etc etc &amp; so
<lb/> it goes on. The really awful part
<lb/> of the thing is that this time
<lb/> 2 years ago I was junior 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> Lieut
<lb/> on a month's probation in the
<lb/> Battalion I tonight command &amp; am
<lb/> the only officer with it tonight who
<lb/> have served in France etc right
<lb/>thro' with it. It is one of the
<lb/> most decorated if not <hi rend="underline">the</hi>  most
<lb/> decorated Battalion in our Corps.
<lb/>It is by far the most decorated
<lb/> Batt. in our Division &amp; that is
        
    
         
        <pb n="5604" facs="#L1916_2171_img_5604"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>a very special honour to begin
<lb/> with. The awful pity of it is
<lb/> that more of our home birds
<lb/> <sic>arnt</sic> coming out to us. I would
<lb/> rather have them than any
<lb/> others in all the world.</p>
<p>Well this all seems to be about
<lb/> me, but there is so little else I
<lb/> am permitted to write about that
<lb/> you will please accept this fact
<lb/> as my excuse.</p>
<p>I am well &amp; in the very best of
<lb/> form &amp; very much looking
<lb/> forward to my next leave
<lb/> which I hope to have in the
<lb/> forepart of next month.</p>
<p>All my love to mother</p>
<salute>Your affectionate son</salute>
