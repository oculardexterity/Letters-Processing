                            <p>Letter from Fr James Brennan SJ (1854-1941), Rector of Rathfarnham Castle to his Father Provincial Thomas V Nolan SJ (1867-1941), 21 August 1916. The letter from Fr James Brennan SJ to his provincial concerns the travel plans for Juniors who had completed their academic studies and were to apply for permits to travel to Jersey, to start their philosophical studies. Brennan was worried about their travel plans and commented that ‘eight fine young fellows of military age, travelling together would attract attention in these anxious days…some of the Roehampton Juniors (British Jesuits) were presented with white feathers in London’. During the First World War, in order to shame men into enlisting in the British Army, women presented men not wearing military uniform with a white feather to signify cowardice. As a consequence, the Juniors travelled to Jersey in two groups.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Rathfarnham Castle was bought by the Irish Jesuits in 1913 and used a house of studies for those Jesuits attending university. This decision was made following the change of regulations to the National University requiring students to attend lectures whereas previously they could be prepared for examinations elsewhere. The Jesuit Juniors as they were known would live at the Castle and cycle to lectures at University College Dublin, then located at Earlsfort Terrace in the centre of Dublin.</p>
