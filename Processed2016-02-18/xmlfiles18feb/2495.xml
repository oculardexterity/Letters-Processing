                            <p>Letter from Peter Mooney (b.1886) to his sister, Katie (b.1884).  Peter writes her news of his health and complains that the meat that is being served is not the best. He describes the weather as cold and rainy. He writes about the fair and longs to be back with the animals on the farm. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Orphaned at age 7, Peter and his sister Katie were raised by their uncle William and his wife Mary in Caulstown. While there are no surviving enlistment papers for Peter, his War Badge Index Record shows his enlistment date as 18 October 1915. He served with the Royal Artillery and later transferred to the Royal Engineers where he was promoted to the rank of Sergeant. He served in several places at the Western Front, including Ypres, St. Omer and Passchendael. Peter and Kate were avid correspondents. This letter part of a collection of over ninety surviving letters.</p>

<salute>Dear Katie,</salute>
<p>I hope this letter will find you all in the
<lb/>best of health. It is a good while since I had a
<lb/> letter from home now. I feel i the best of health &amp;
<lb/>spirits just get better along alright. I had a letter from 
<lb/>home from <unclear>Howth</unclear>. He said you looked great
<lb/>improved. I was glad to hear it. The weather is 
<lb/>not so bad out here yet we have an odd days rain
<lb/>it is not too cold yet. I hope to receive the <unclear>Putters</unclear> &amp;
<lb/>cardigan in a few days &amp; they will be useful when
<lb/>the wet days of winter come along. I had a letter
<lb/>from John Bruton during the week he said cattle were
<lb/>not <unclear>paying</unclear> so well but he expects them to improve.
<lb/>I wish I could attend Ballinasloe Big fair this
<lb/>year. I hope next year next year I will be there it would be
<lb/>Heaven to me to get <unclear>mind of</unclear> with the cattle &amp; sheep
<lb/>again. I hope everything is going on alright in both
<lb/>places. I wrote to the <unclear>governor</unclear> a few days ago I did
<lb/>not hear from him yet. Remember me to all down the
<lb/>Paddock <unclear>way</unclear>. I ask both my Aunt &amp; yourself not to
<lb/>worry about <add>me</add> as I am not in any great danger &amp; I hope
<lb/>to get through alright. I now say Good-Bye &amp; May God 
<lb/>Bless &amp; keep you all.</p>

<salute>Dear Katie,</salute></opener>
<p>I hope this letter will find you all in the
<lb/>best of health. It is a good while since I had a
<lb/> letter from home now. I feel i the best of health &amp;
<lb/>spirits just get better along alright. I had a letter from 
<lb/><unclear>Lawrence Kennedy</unclear>. He told me he is going
<lb/>home from Howth. He said you looked greatly
<lb/>improved. I was glad to hear it. The weather is 
<lb/>not so bad out here yet we have an odd days rain
<lb/>it is not too cold yet. I hope to receive the <unclear>Putties</unclear> &amp;
<lb/>cardigan in a few days &amp; they will be useful when
<lb/>the wet days of winter come along. I had a letter
<lb/>from John Bruton during the week he said cattle were
<lb/>not <unclear>paying</unclear> so well but he expects them to improve.
<lb/>I wish I could attend Ballinasloe Big fair this
<lb/>year. I hope next year next year I will be there it would be
<lb/>Heaven to me to get <unclear>mind of</unclear> with the cattle &amp; sheep
<lb/>again. I hope everything is going on alright in both
<lb/>places. I wrote to the <unclear>governor</unclear> a few days ago I did
<lb/>not hear from him yet. Remember me to all down the
<lb/>Paddock <unclear>way</unclear>. I ask both my Aunt &amp; yourself not to
<lb/>worry about <add>me</add> as I am not in any great danger &amp; I hope
<lb/>to get through alright. I now say Good-Bye &amp; May God 
<lb/>Bless &amp; keep you all.</p>
