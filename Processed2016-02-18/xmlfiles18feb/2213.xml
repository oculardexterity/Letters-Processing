                            <p>A letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his sister, Kathleen. Davidson thanks his sister Kathleen for food parcels. He writes  her that the usual intermittent strafing with little damage is continuing; the weather is cold with snow;  the trenches are collapsing and his men spend all their time repairing the encampment. He has a heavy cold although the wound (sustained on 27 Feb) has healed completely. He informs Kathleen that the plane that dropped the bomb that injured him  was around again and was nearly shot down. He again refers to the unnecessary anxiety caused by the telegram about his injury and regrets that leave has not yet been reinstated.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

My dearest Kathleen &#x2014; I have received two<lb/>
letters each from you &amp; Mother since I wrote<lb/>
last &amp; beside the usual parcels there arrived<lb/>
safely one with mufflers &amp; a box of apples.<lb/>
My best thanks for all.  There is not much<lb/>
in the way of news the usual intermittent<lb/>
shraffing has been going on with very little damage<lb/>
at least as far as we are concerned.  The<lb/>
weather however has been perfectly awful &#x2014;<lb/>
snow &amp; storm then thaw &amp;more snow.<lb/>
Today it has almost disappeared but tonight<lb/>
it has started again &amp; the cold is intense.<lb/>
The trenches are appalling in some places.<lb/>
No sooner is one place propped up than<lb/>
another falls in.  My men spend all their <lb/>
time repairing the emplacements &amp; the approaches.<lb/>
I have had another bad cold &amp; spent most of<lb/>
yest in bed but today rather better&amp; able to <lb/>
be about.  Expect I shall be all right again <lb/>
in a few days but as you can imagine it's<lb/>
not easy to throw<del>n</del> off a cold under the conditions<lb/>
out here.   The cut in my arm is of course<lb/>
almost healed up &amp; never gave me a moments<lb/>
trouble.  The same old aeroplane was<lb/>

<salute>My dearest Kathleen</salute> &#x2014; I have received two<lb/>
letters each from you &amp; Mother since I wrote<lb/>
last &amp; beside the usual parcels there arrived<lb/>
safely one with mufflers &amp; a box of apples.<lb/>
My best thanks for all.  There is not much<lb/>
in the way of news the usual intermittent<lb/>
straffing has been going on with very little damage<lb/>
at least as far as we are concerned.  The<lb/>
weather however has been perfectly awful &#x2014;<lb/>
snow &amp; storm then thaw &amp;more snow.<lb/>
Today it has almost disappeared but tonight<lb/>
it has started again &amp; the cold is intense.<lb/>
The trenches are appalling in some places.<lb/>
No sooner is one place propped up than<lb/>
another falls in.  My men spend all their <lb/>
time repairing the emplacements &amp; the approaches.<lb/>
I have had another bad cold &amp; spent most of<lb/>
yest in bed but today rather better&amp; able to <lb/>
be about.  Expect I shall be all right again <lb/>
in a few days but as you can imagine it's<lb/>
not easy to throw<del>n</del> off a cold under the conditions<lb/>
out here.   The cut in my arm is of course<lb/>
almost healed up &amp; never gave me a moments<lb/>
