                            <p>Letter from William Sheehan (b.1877), clerk of the Fermoy Urban District, to Ivor Guest, the Lord Wimborne, (1873-1939), lord lieutenant of Ireland. The letter concerns a malicious injury  claim made by Sarah J. Rowe (b.1868) due to the death of her husband William N. Rowe (1867-1916), RIC constable who was shot in an attempt to arrest members of the Kent family in connection with Sinn Fein activity in County Cork. Thomas Kent (1865-1916) was later executed for the murder of Constable Rowe. The letter also has a copy of a resolution made regarding the case, calling on the authorities to pay Mrs Rowe some form of compensation. It goes on to state that the application for the fund to be levied off the rate payers should be withdrawn, so not to disturb the peace.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p> Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne was appointed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1915. Guest worked closely alongside Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939) in the administration of Ireland. Following the suppression of the Rising, Guest, under pressure, was forced to resign as Lord Lieutenant. A later inquiry into the Rising exonerated Guest and held Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) chiefly responsible for the events that occurred. Guest would continue to serve as Lord Lieutenant until 1918.</p>

Fermoy,</address> 
<dateline><date>26th May 1916</date></dateline></addrLine>
<addrLine>To.
<address>His Excellency Baron Wimborne</addrLine>
<addrLine>Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Dublin Castle.</addrLine></address>

<salute>May it please Your Excellency:</salute></opener>
<p>I am directed by the Fermoy Urban
<lb/>Council to transmit to you the undermentioned Resolution in
<lb/>reference to the Malicious Injury Claim lodged by Mrs Rowe for
<lb/>£2500 compensation for the death of her husband the late Head Const
<lb/>Rowe, which occurred on the 2nd inst.</p>
<salute>I remain,
<lb/>Your Excellency's,
<lb/>Most Obedient Servant</salute>
<signed>Wm Sheehan</signed>
<lb/>Town Clerk.

<lb/>Copy Resolution
<p>"That solely with a view to the continuance of the
<lb/>"good, peaceable, and law abiding character of this District, and to
<lb/>"obviate any cause of friction or ill feeling, We most earnestly urge
<lb/>"on the Authorities to provide out of some fund at their disposal such
<lb/>"compensation to the Family of the late Head Constable Rowe R.I.C,
<lb/>"Fermoy, as they may justly be considered <sic>entutled</sic> to for his loss which
<lb/>"we all regret, and that the pending application of his Widow for
<lb/>"compensation to be levied off the Ratepayers should be withdrawn.
<lb/>"We do not desire to express any opinion as to the merits or otherwise
<lb/>"of the application, but we consider that the levying of such a Decree
<lb/>"for compensation off the Ratepayers would inevitably provoke a
<lb/>"disturbance of the peace of the District and lead to a repetition of
<lb/>"the unfortunate occurrences with which this Barony of Condons and
<lb/>Clongibbons was visited in the Eighties".</p>

<note>I ack
<lb/> II <gap/>
<lb/> Please say what pension
<lb/> may be paid to Mrs Rowe under
<lb/> the R.I.C. Acts. 29-5-16</note>
