                            <p>Charles Wynne served as a captain in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. His application to the Royal Flying Corps was denied in 1916 due to his poor eyesight. Charles ultimately died of wounds received at Armentieres, June 1917.</p>

13th Oct
Dear Aunt Sophy,
Thanks so much for your letter - you needn't be a bit afraid of writing too much! that is if you don't expect many answers, as you know what a rotten correspondent I am. We have been very busy up till now and this is my sixth letter this afternoon - not too bad for me! I expect you may have heard most of my news already, e.g. how I started with the advance party of the battery and was put to clean up and scavenge three different battery positions and in the end the battery went to

There is terrible confusion and mess up out here, but I suppose in the end things gradually get done. The place where the battery is now is splendid. The other place where I went first is by no means ideal - an old battlefield of the French, utter desolation & plenty of legs & arms and bones and old boots & none too pure an atmosphere and digging in same place is by no means amusing. I went for a walk round the place with the Col General when I first arrived and he showed me a boat in which he said a short time ago a leg was sticking out a mark used as a sign post for pointing out the way. As for the village if one looks carefully in the grass one may find where the walls stood but in places it's not easy. Over here things are much better the village is more or less intact in fact some houses including the one we're in have roofs a very pleasant change after dirty dugouts. The food here is good and we're as comfortable as princes but everything is in awful confusion and muddle.

We have not been doing much shooting and one of the guns has already gone back broken to England. This part of the line is very quiet the Bosch sends very little stuff over, none has yet come near me.

<salute>Dear Aunt Sophy,</salute>
<p>Thanks so much for your
<lb/> letter &#x2014; you needn't be a bit afraid
<lb/> of writing too much! that is if
<lb/> you don't expect many answers,
<lb/> as you know what a rotten
<lb/> correspondent I am. We have been
<lb/> very busy up till now and this
<lb/> is my sixth letter this afternoon 
<lb/> not too bad for me! I expect
<lb/> you may have heard most
<lb/> of my news already, e.g. how
<lb/> I started with the advance party 
<lb/> of the battery and was put to
<lb/> clean up and scavenge three
<lb/> different battery positions and
<lb/> in the end the battery went to

<lb/>an entirely different position
<lb/> and <del>the</del> my party were taken 
<lb/>by the R.E. for a fatigue party
<lb/> to rejoin the battery in three 
<lb/>weeks! There is terrible confusion
<lb/> and mess up out here, but I
<lb/> suppose in the end things gradually
<lb/> get done. The place where
<lb/> the battery is now is splendid. The
<lb/> other place where I went first
<lb/> is by no means ideal &#x2014; an old
<lb/> battlefield of the French, utter
<lb/> desolation &amp; plenty of legs &amp; arms
<lb/> and bones and old boots &amp; none
<lb/> too pure an atmosphere and digging
<lb/> in same place is by no means
<lb/> amusing. I went for a walk
<lb/> round the place with the Col 
<lb/>General when I first arrived
<pb/> 
<lb/>and he showed me a boat
<lb/> in which he said a short
<lb/> time ago a leg was sticking
<lb/> out a mark used as a 
<lb/>sign post for pointing out
<lb/> the way. As for the village
<lb/> if one looks carefully in the
<lb/> grass one may find where
<lb/> the walls stood but in places
<lb/> it's not easy. Over here
<lb/> things are much better the
<lb/> village is more or less intact
<lb/> in fact some houses including 
<lb/>the one we're in actually have
<lb/> roofs a very pleasant change
<lb/> after dirty dugouts. The
<lb/> food here is good and we're
<lb/> as comfortable as princes
<lb/> but everything is in awful
<lb/> confusion and muddle.

<salute>Dear Aunt Sophy,</salute></opener>
<p>Thanks so much for your
<lb/> letter &#x2014; you needn't be a bit afraid
<lb/> of writing too much! that is if
<lb/> you don't expect many answers,
<lb/> as you know what a rotten
<lb/> correspondent I am. We have been
<lb/> very busy up till now and this
<lb/> is my sixth letter this afternoon 
<lb/> not too bad for me! I expect
<lb/> you may have heard most
<lb/> of my news already, e.g. how
<lb/> I started with the advance party 
<lb/> of the battery and was put to
<lb/> clean up and scavenge three
<lb/> different battery positions and
<lb/> in the end the battery went to
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="695" facs="#L1916_264_img_695"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>an entirely different position
<lb/> and <del>the</del> my party were taken 
<lb/>by the R.E. for a fatigue party
<lb/> to rejoin the battery in three 
<lb/>weeks! There is terrible confusion
<lb/> and mess up out here, but I
<lb/> suppose in the end things gradually
<lb/> get done. The place where
<lb/> the battery is now is splendid. The
<lb/> other place where I went first
<lb/> is by no means ideal &#x2014; an old
<lb/> battlefield of the French, utter
<lb/> desolation &amp; plenty of legs &amp; arms
<lb/> and bones and old boots &amp; none
<lb/> too pure an atmosphere and digging
<lb/> in same place is by no means
<lb/> amusing. I went for a walk
<lb/> round the place with the Col 
<lb/>General when I first arrived
<pb/> 
<lb/>and he showed me a boat
<lb/> in which he said a short
<lb/> time ago a leg was sticking
<lb/> out a mark used as a 
<lb/>sign post for pointing out
<lb/> the way. As for the village
<lb/> if one looks carefully in the
<lb/> grass one may find where
<lb/> the walls stood but in places
<lb/> it's not easy. Over here
<lb/> things are much better the
<lb/> village is more or less intact
<lb/> in fact some houses including 
<lb/>the one we're in actually have
<lb/> roofs a very pleasant change
<lb/> after dirty dugouts. The
<lb/> food here is good and we're
<lb/> as comfortable as princes
<lb/> but everything is in awful
<lb/> confusion and muddle.

<p>We have not been doing
<lb/> much shooting and one of the 
<lb/>guns has already gone back
<lb/> broken to England. This 
<lb/>part of the line is very quiet
<lb/> the Bosch sends very little stuff
<lb/> over, none has yet come
<lb/> near me. You're right
<lb/> about the mud in some of 
<lb/> the trenches to the observation 
<lb/> posts one has to walk with
<lb/> a foot stuck against either side
<lb/> of the trench as it's hopeless to
<lb/> attempt to walk along the
<lb/> bottom. &#x2014; The country is an
<lb/> awful network of wires every 
<lb/> where you go.</p>
