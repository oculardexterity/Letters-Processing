                            <p>This correspondence, comprising three letters, concerns a request from Count Demetrius Salazar, son of the Italian Consul in Ireland for naturalisation in order that he may qualify for an Army Commission. Representations were made by the Count to the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Wimborne (Ivor Guest) (1873-1938), whose Private Secretary (Sir Basil Blackwood)  begins the correspondence on 22 May.   The writer of the letter to Mr. Ferrant is seeking to have the matter brought to the appropriate official and to expedite the matter as much as possible.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p> Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne was appointed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1915. Guest worked closely alongside Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939) in the administration of Ireland. Following the suppression of the Rising, Guest, under pressure, was forced to resign as Lord Lieutenant. A later inquiry into the Rising exonerated Guest and held Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) chiefly responsible for the events that occurred. Guest would continue to serve as Lord Lieutenant until 1918.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Farrant,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your letter as to the Criminal<lb/>
Statistics. We shall at once consider the desirability<lb/>
of following your good example.</p>
<p>Count Demet<add>ei</add>us Salazar, son of the Italian<lb/>
Consul in Ireland, wishes to become naturalised with a view<lb/>
to getting a commission in the Army, and Lord Wimborne has<lb/>
asked that we should endeavour to have Certificate<lb/>
issued as soon as possible. I do not know to whom I should<lb/>
write in the Home Office, but I shall be greatly obliged if<lb/>
you will communicate this information in the proper quarter.</p>
<p>The application was sent to the Home Office<lb/>
on the 23rd instant, but up to the present we have not been<lb/>
asked to report.</p>
<salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
