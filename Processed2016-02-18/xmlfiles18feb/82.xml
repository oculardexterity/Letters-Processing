                            <p>Letter from J.Eyre to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928) concerning the use of sphagnum moss.  This moss was, during the Great War, used for surgical dressings due to a shortage of cotton wool, as well for as its medicinal benefits for combating infection. J. Eyre (most likely John Eyre) is writing to inform Lady Clonbrock that his sister-in-law would be able to acquire more moss, most probably to meet an increased demand in the local hospital.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Clonbrock,</salute></opener>
<p>Several people <unclear>around</unclear> 
<lb/> here have been collecting 
<lb/> Spaghnum Moss for a 
<lb/> long time. My sister-in-law
<lb/> has been sending 
<lb/>some to a Depot she 
<lb/> is interested in Brighton, 
<lb/> but she asks me to say
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="328" facs="#L1916_82_img_328"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>that she will be very glad 
<lb/> to send all she can 
<lb/> get to your depot. She
<lb/> would not like to promise 
<lb/> it at any given time as 
<lb/> so much depends on weather 
<lb/>for drying &amp;  at present the 
<lb/> bogs are too wet for anything.
<lb/>Mrs Aldridge has been 
<lb/> working at Spagnum for 
<pb/>
<lb/>some time at the weekly 
<lb/> Red X meetings which 
<lb/> she holds in the school. 
<lb/>  I will read your circular
<lb/> at their next gathering, 
<lb/> &amp; find out what they 
<lb/> will do. Mean while 
<lb/>may we have some more 
<lb/>of the papers of instruction.
