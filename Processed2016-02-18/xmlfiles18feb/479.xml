                            <p>A mobilisation order from William Pearse (1881-1916) to Michael Joseph O'Rahilly ('The O'Rahilly') (1875-1916). Attached is an account of the O'Rahilly's last moments, detailing his charge down Moore street and the writing of his last note.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p> William Pearse was the brother of Patrick Pearse and fought under him in the GPO during the Easter Rising. He held the rank of captain and served on occasion as acting chief of staff but in reality had no power. Despite this, he pleaded guilty at his court martial and was executed on 4 May. Michael Joseph O'Rahilly was involved in the procurement of arms in the lead-up to the Rising and was involved in the Howth gun-running incident. He fought in the G.P.O. During the Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later.</p>
