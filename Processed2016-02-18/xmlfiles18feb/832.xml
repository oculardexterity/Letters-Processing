                            <p>Letter from Mabel FitzGerald (1884-1957) to the Brigadier General, Richmond Barracks. Mabel writes to query the sentence imposed on her husband, Desmond FitzGerald, (1888-1947), politician, poet, and revolutionary. He was sentenced at Court-Martial to 20 years Penal Servitude, later reduced to 10 years. Mrs FitzGerald protests as, she claims, while her husband was present in the G.P.O. during the fighting, he was a non-combatant. Furthermore, she writes, he wasn't involved in the planning of the Rising.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p> Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

2 Loretto Villas, Bray.
22.5.1916

The Brigadier General, Richmond Barracks, Dublin.
Sir,
In reply to yours of 20th inst 109/A. as my husband was non-combatant and held no rank whatsoever in the Volunteers and as I understand from him that Lieut.King who was a prisoner in the G.P.O. made a deposition that he was a non combatant, I think some grave blunder has been made in sentencing him to <del>two</del>twenty years Penal Servitude, a blunder which is not by any <del>men</del>means rectified by the remittance of ten years.
I understand from my husband that the only evidence against him was his own statement, in which he voluntarily admitted his presence in the G.P.O. and stated the part which he took in non-combatant work, and that he was neither trained or equipped to fight. Had he been, he would not have been told <del>of</del>off to take women and <del>children</del>wounded to a place of safety when the <del>G.</del>G.P.O. was on fire.
It is obvious that when he was in Mountjoy Prison <sic>fr</sic>for a Speech from last October till within three weeks of the Rebellion he had no share in planning it. As, therefore, he was neither responsible for it, nor did he take a prominent or even a belligerent part in it, the sentence of 20 years can only have been passed by error, and that it was confirmed with remittance of only 10 years is evidence that the full facts of the case could not have been familiar t the General Officer Commanding in Chief.
I am,
Yours faithfully
Mabel W.Fitzgerald

<p>In reply to yours of 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> (inst 109/A.) as my husban<add>d</add>
<lb/> was a non-combatant and held no rank whatsoever in the Volunteers
<lb/> and as I understand from him that Lieut. King who was a prisoner
<lb/> in the G.P.O. made a deposition that he was a non combatant, I
<lb/> think some grave blunder has been made in sentencing him to <del>two</del>
<lb/>twenty years Penal Servitude, a blunder which is not by any <del>men</del>
<lb/> means rectified by the remittance of ten years.</p>
<p>I understand from my husband that the only evidence
<lb/> against him was his own statement, in which he voluntarily admitted
<lb/> his presence in the G.P.O. and stated the part which he
<lb/> took in non-combatant work, and that he was neither trained nor
<lb/> equipped to fight. Had he been, he would not have been told <del>of</del>
<lb/> off to take women and <del>children</del><add>wounded</add> to a place of safety when the <del>G.</del>
<lb/>G.P.O. was on fire.</p>
<p>It is obvious that when he was in Mountjoy Prison <sic>fr</sic>
<lb/>for a Speech from last October till within three weeks of the
<lb/> Rebellion he had no share in planning it. As, therefore, he
<lb/> was neither responsible for it, nor did he take a prominent or <sic>e</sic>
<lb/> even a belligerent part in it, the sentence of 20 years can on<add>ly</add>
<lb/> only have been passed by error, and that it was confirmed with
<lb/> remittance of only 10 years is evidence that the full facts of
<lb/> the case could not have been familiar to the General Officer
<lb/> Commanding in Chief.</p>

<lb/>Yours faithfully</salute>
