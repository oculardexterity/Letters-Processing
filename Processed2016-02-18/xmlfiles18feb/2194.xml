We are back "resting" now <lb/> for eight days, but we are not in <lb/> a very restful place. The Huns <lb/> shell it several times every day & <lb/> there are frequent casualties. Before <lb/> we came here on Tuesday I had been<lb/> ??? days in the front line & arriving <pb/>

<lb/>that time I never had my clothes 
<lb/> off. The Battalions relieve one another 
<lb/> every four days, but the Leinsters 
<lb/> had no chaplains of their own so 
<lb/> I stayed on with them &amp; so was 
<lb/> in the whole <unclear>16</unclear> days. I have now 
<lb/>been appointed officially to the 
<lb/> two battalions &amp; as they always 
<lb/> relieve each other I expect I 
<lb/> shall get as much of the game 
<lb/> as I want. It is a very terrible 
<lb/> thing where a show is on &amp; no 
<lb/> one I know wants any more 
<lb/> of it than he has seen if he has 
<lb/> been in it at all. But of course 
<lb/> all have to see it through &amp; the 
<lb/> men are really splendid. The 
<lb/> last sixteen days was the worst 
<lb/> turn we had. There was a constant 
<lb/> strain the whole time. Between

<lb/> But they did good work &amp; the
<lb/>enemy got a good deal more than 
<lb/> they gave. It is dreadful to see 
<lb/> the way the poor fellows are 
<lb/>broken &amp; mangled sometimes out

<p>Well, there is no use telling

<lb/> you know all its phases.</p> 
<p>I suppose Visitations are

<lb/> in full swing. I hope you &amp; 
<lb/> all in the Province are very 
<lb/> well. You are, I am sure busy

<salute>My dear Fr. Provincial, 
<hi rend="underline">P.C.</hi></salute></opener> 
<p> I am a very bad 
<lb/> correspondent &amp; the atmosphere 
<lb/> we live in out here is not 
<lb/> conducive to letter writing. Since 
<lb/> I came back on Holy Thursday I 
<lb/> have never been away from these 
<lb/> horrible guns except one day for 
<lb/> a few hours when I took a ride 
<lb/> a few miles back into the country 
<lb/> for the sake of feeling I was out of 
<lb/> range. We are back "resting" now 
<lb/> for eight days, but we are not in 
<lb/> a very restful place. The Huns 
<lb/> shell it several times every day &amp; 
<lb/> there are frequent casualties. Before 
<lb/> we came here on Tuesday I had been
<lb/> <unclear>16</unclear> days in the front line &amp; during
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="5706" facs="#L1916_2194_img_5706"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>that time I never had my clothes 
<lb/> off. The Battalions relieve one another 
<lb/> every four days, but the Leinsters 
<lb/> had no chaplains of their own so 
<lb/> I stayed on with them &amp; so was 
<lb/> in the whole <unclear>16</unclear> days. I have now 
<lb/>been appointed officially to the 
<lb/> two battalions &amp; as they always 
<lb/> relieve each other I expect I 
<lb/> shall get as much of the game 
<lb/> as I want. It is a very terrible 
<lb/> thing where a show is on &amp; no 
<lb/> one I know wants any more 
<lb/> of it than he has seen if he has 
<lb/> been in it at all. But of course 
<lb/> all have to see it through &amp; the 
<lb/> men are really splendid. The 
<lb/> last sixteen days was the worst 
<lb/> turn we had. There was a constant 
<lb/> strain the whole time. Between 
<lb/> killed &amp; wounded we lost in that
        
    
         
        <pb n="5707" facs="#L1916_2194_img_5707"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>period quite a fourth of our Battalions 
<lb/> &amp; the Leinsters nearly as many. 
<lb/> But they did good work &amp; the
<lb/>enemy got a good deal more than 
<lb/> they gave. It is dreadful to see 
<lb/> the way the poor fellows are 
<lb/>broken &amp; mangled sometimes out 
<lb/> of all recognition. When they are 
<lb/> killed it does not seem so bad,
<lb/> but it is terrible to see the horrible 
<lb/> wounds &amp; the way the poor fellows 
<lb/> suffer. Their sufferings are added to by 
<lb/> the inconvenience of the trenches, 
<lb/> where it is often difficult for two 
<lb/> men to pass. It often takes hours 
<lb/> to get them as far as the regimental 
<lb/> aid post which is by no means a 
<lb/> <unclear>luxurious</unclear> place &#x2014; often only a very 
<lb/> small dug-out &amp; the wounded can 
<lb/> only be sent down to the clearing 
<lb/> stations by night when it is dark, 
<lb/> so that they are often 18 or 20 hours
        
    
         
        <pb n="5708" facs="#L1916_2194_img_5708"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>waiting. It can't be helped 
<lb/> but it causes much suffering to 
<lb/> the poor men.</p>
<p>Well, there is no use telling 
<lb/> you about war as you have had 
<lb/> so much of it in Dublin that 
<lb/> you know all its phases.</p> 
<p>I suppose Visitations are 
<lb/> all over by this &amp; the villas 
<lb/> in full swing. I hope you &amp; 
<lb/> all in the Province are very 
<lb/> well. You are, I am sure busy 
<lb/> with retreats just now. I hope 
<lb/> we shall also soon be engaged 
<lb/> in that way &#x2014; the retreat of the 
<lb/> Huns.</p>

<lb/> &amp; asking a remembrance in your Holy 
<lb/> Sacrifices Believe me, my dear Fr. Provincial. 
<lb/>Yours most sincerely in XT</salute>
