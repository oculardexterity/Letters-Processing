                            <p>This is an undated letter from Éamon de Valera (1882-1975) to his wife, Sinéad de Valera (1882-1975), written around April or May 1916. The letter may have been written from Boland's Mills before the surrender, or after his arrest but before his sentence was commuted. He says 'if I die' suggesting that he either expected to die in battle or was unsure about whether a death sentence would be passed.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Éamon de Valera had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and was adjutant to Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), Dublin Brigade commandant. He went on to command forces at Bolands Mill during the Rising and was the most senior participant to escape execution. De Valera would go on to become one of the most influential figures in Ireland's 20th century. Sinéad de Valera (née O'Flanagan) was pregnant and without an income while her husband was in prison, and was forced to return to the family home in Phibsboro to care for her invalid sister and mother. Throughout much of the ensuing political upheaval she saw little of her husband, who was either imprisoned or on the run.</p>
