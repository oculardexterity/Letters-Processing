                            <p>Next of kin letter to Mrs Rankin whose son Ian died of wounds in a Canadian Hospital from the Rev Robert Kelso, Principal Chaplain's Dept,Bologne Base, B.E.F. France. Rev Kelso advises that Ian had initially showed signs of recovery but then relapsed and died without much pain or suffering. He offered his sympathy and stated that the doctors and nurses had done everything possible for her son but she was one of many mothers called upon to make the great sacrifice. He hoped and prayed that she would find the strength to bear the strain. He gave details of the burial in France on 6/10/16 grave# 4026.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs BurnsI</salute>
<p>I am sure you will have heard the<lb/>
sad news of your son's death &amp; I feel I must write to say<lb/>
how much I feel for you in your loss.  After my last<lb/>
letter <del>you </del>to you he was so much better that he said he<lb/>
had written you himself so I did not do so.  I thought <lb/>
he was on the sure road to recovery &amp;I was terribly<lb/>
disappointed when he suddenly became worse &amp;passed<lb/>
away.  He was in such good spirits &amp;and so confident<lb/>
of recovery, that the relapse was - to me - as unexpected<lb/>
as it was sudden.  He was buried in the Military<lb/>
Cemetery here &#x2014; on 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <del>Sept.</del>Oct with full Military Honours<lb/>
 &amp; the number of his grave is 4039.  The Authorities <lb/>
will send you a photo of the grave on application to<lb/>
 "Director of Graves Registration &amp; Enquiries War Office<lb/>
Winchester House, St. Jame's Sq. London S.W." but<lb/>
it may be a little time before they can reply to you<lb/>.
  Will you please accept my sincerest sympathy &amp; believe<lb/>
 me when I say that everything possible was done for your<lb/>
son's comfort &amp;welfare while in Hospital.  He has <lb/> made the great sacrifice &amp; such a life &amp;death as his must<lb/>
surely be well pleasing in the sight of Him who said <gap/><lb/>
Greater love hath no man than the life a man lays down<lb/
>his life for his friends.</p>

<salute>sincerely yours </salute>

<salute>Dear Mrs Burns,</salute> <p>I am sure you will have heard the<lb/>sad news of your son's death &amp; I feel I must write to say<lb/> how much I feel for you in your loss.  After my last<lb/> letter <del>you</del> to you he was so much better that he said he<lb/> had written you himself so I did not do so.  I thought he was on the sure road to recovery and I was terribly<lb/>disappointed when he suddenly became worse &amp;<lb/>away.  He was in such good spirits and so confident<lb/>of recovery that the relapse was - to me - as unexpected<lb/> as it was sudden.  He was buried in the Military<lb/>Cemetery here - on 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <del>Sept</del> Oct. with full Military Honours<lb/>&amp; the number of the grave is - 4039.

<salute>Dear Mrs Burns</salute></opener> 
<p>I am sure you will have heard the
<lb/>sad news of your son's death &amp; I feel I must write to say
<lb/> how much I feel for you in your loss.  After my last
<lb/> letter <del>you</del> <add>to</add> you he was so much better that he said he
<lb/> had written you himself so I did not do so.  I thought 
<lb/>he was on the sure road to recovery &amp; I was terribly
<lb/>disappointed when he suddenly became worse &amp; passed
<lb/>away.  He was in such good spirits &amp; so confident
<lb/>of recovery that the relapse was &#x2014; to me &#x2014; as unexpected
<lb/> as it was sudden.  He was buried in the Military
<lb/>Cemetery here &#x2014; on 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <del>Sept</del> Oct. with full Military Honours
<lb/>&amp; the number of the grave is  4039.  The <sic>Authoritie</sic>
<lb/>will send you a photo of the grave on application to
<lb/> "Director of Graves Registration &amp; Enquiries, War Office,
<lb/> Winchester House, St James' Sq. London S.W." but
<lb/> it may be a little time before they can reply to you.  
<lb/>Will you please accept my sincerest sympathy &amp; believe
<lb/> me when I say that everything possible was done for your 
<lb/> son's comfort and welfare while in Hospital. He has
<lb/> made the Great Sacrifice &amp; such a life and death as his must
<lb/> surely be well-pleasing in the sight of Him who said
<lb/> "Greater Love Hath no man than this that a man lay down
<lb/> his life for his friends."<p>
