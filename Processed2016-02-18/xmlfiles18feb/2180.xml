                            <p>Letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his mother, Clara. Davidson writes a short note to his mother that he has had unofficial news that his Battalion will be sent to the front line. He asks her to dispatch a bag to him as soon as possible so he has it before he leaves.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

I posted a letter to you today<lb/>
but I have since heard unofficially that we<lb/>

leaving for some part of the line at very<lb/>
short notice, so this is just a hurried note<lb/>

as quickly as possible. I am afraid<lb/>

I suspect we shall go to one of the 'hot spots' this<lb/>

<salute>My dear mother,</salute></opener>
<p>I posted a letter to you today
<lb/> but I have since heard unofficially that we
<lb/> are not to be here much longer &amp; will be
<lb/> leaving for some part of the line at very
<lb/> short notice, so this is just a hurried note
<lb/> to ask you to hurry Erskine with my green
<lb/> canvas kit bag &amp; have it dispatched
<lb/> as quickly as possible. I am afraid
<lb/> that even as it is, it can hardly be here
<lb/> in time for our move, however perhaps we
<lb/> may not be off so soon as at present anticipated.
<lb/> I suspect we shall go to one of the "Hot Spots" this
<lb/> time at least that seems to be the general
<lb/> impression. Of course wherever we are
<lb/> things will reach me all right, only if possible
<lb/> I would like the bag before we move.</p>
