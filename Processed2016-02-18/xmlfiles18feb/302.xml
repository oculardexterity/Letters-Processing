                            <p>A letter from Austin Stack (1879-1929) presumably to Maureen (Mair√≠n) Cregan, a prolific Irish children's writer who married James Ryan (1891-1970). The letter was written from Kilmainham Gaol before Stack was sent to prison in the United Kingdom. In the letter he speculates that he will get a long sentences as the Chief Crown Solicitor claimed he should have been executed ('backed the wall'). He complains about the use of evidence during the courts martial and hopes that Michael Collins, who had a minor role in the Rising, would get a lenient sentence, describing him as 'an unfortunate victim to circumstances'.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Austin Stack, revolutionary, politician, was commandant of the Kerry Brigade of the Irish Volunteers and made preparations to receive Roger Casement. Stack was sentenced to death for his part in the Easter Rising, but this later commuted to penal servitude for life and he was released in 1917.</p>

Kilmainham Gaol
18th June 1916

My dear Maureen,
I am sure you will not be able to see us again before we are sent away. I do not know what sentences we may receive but I am prepared for a long term as the Chief Crown Solicitor told Dr. O'Connell on Friday night that I should have "backed the wall". They failed to make out any case against us but what do the court-martial care about such trifles as legal evidence when the authorities want people out of the way?
I hope Collins gets off light as he was an unfortunate victim to circumstances. He, at any rate, should have been acquitted.
But we shall survive it all with God's help, and meet our friends again.
Goodbye, brave little woman, and say an occasional prayer for 
Ireland's unworthy son
Austin Stack

<lb/>we are sent away. I do not know
<lb/>what sentences we may receive
<lb/>but I am prepared for a long term

<lb/>O'Connell on Friday night that I
<lb/>should have "backed the wall". They
<lb/>failed to make out any case against us
<lb/>but what do the Court-martial care about
<lb/>such trifles as legal evidence when the
