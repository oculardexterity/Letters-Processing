                            <p>A letter from Patrick Langford Beazley to his son, Piaras Béaslaí (1881-1965).  Patrick writes to his son concerning the blackouts being imposed in the Liverpool area. He describes the moving about at night 'like ghosts,' that people lose their way and sometimes bump into each other. The blackouts were issued countrywide in response to the increasing number bombing raids mounted by the Imperial German Navy zeppelins.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Patrick Langford Beazley was  born near Killarney, Co. Kerry, son of a tenant who had been evicted from the Lansdowne estate. The Beazleys were an old family in Kerry, of English origin.  Married with Nancy (Nanny) Hickey, he was the father of Piaras Béaslaí. He was the editor of the Catholic Times from 1884 until his death in the early 1920s. Piaras Béaslaí (born Percy Frederick Beazley) was an English born writer, revolutionary, politician, language revivalist, journalist and a member of the IRB. In February of 1916 he published the Fàinne, a publication to organise Gaelic speakers. He soon abandoned it and became involved in politics and would later fight in the Easter Rising. He wrote twenty plays between 1913 and 1939.</p>

My dearest Pierce, 
Why don't you drop me a line? We have been hoping to have a note from you. I trust everything is going well with you. As I have said more than once, if you would like to have a letter such as mother sent, write. I suppose the newspapers in Dublin are rather cutting down ex-

Liverpool last night was almost as dark as Erebus is supposed to be and when I arrived at home I had trouble in finding the garden gate as there is not a single lamp lighted on our street now. I had to light several matches.
Mother and I are quite well but we have no news. Dr. Walsh & his wife called on Sunday. It does not look as if there will be any offspring there.
With fondest love from Mother & myself,
