                            <p>A letter from Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, lady Lillian Spender (1880-1968). In this letter, Spender states that he is getting "a little tired" of sending Christmas wishes, mentions the visit a comrade, Richardson, and suggests that one possible plan for his (Spender's) upcoming leave could be for himself and Lillian to go to a house in Wiltshire owned by his brother Rex. Spender refers to a speech by David Lloyd George (1863-1945), the then Minister for Munitions,  in which he suggested that the war could continue for another year, or more. Spender urges Lillian not to tire herself out writing letters to him, and gives news of the progress of the fighting.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War.</p>

<p>I believe this is really my Xmas letter but I am getting<lb/>
a little tired of sending Xmas greetings even to a p r when I know<lb/>
she now takes them &#x2014; &amp; a lot of other things too &#x2014; quite for granted<lb/>
However I'll wish her one more wish which I know &amp; hope it<lb/>
may come true<lb/></p>

one day in town he will not be able to look you up tho' he took<lb/>
your <del>tel</del> N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> in case there may be a chance later.  I think<lb/>
his wife who lives at 18 Park Avenue <unclear>Bidford</unclear> &amp; who often comes<lb/>
up to town (!) would <del>probably</del> be glad to see you but probably<lb/>
not till after he returns.<lb/></p>

<salute>My pr</salute></opener>

<p>I believe this is really my Xmas letter but I am getting<lb/>
a little tired of sending Xmas greetings even to a pr when I know<lb/>
she now takes them &#x2014; &amp; a lot of other things too &#x2014; quite for granted.<lb/>
However I'll wish her one more wish which I know, &amp; hope it<lb/>
may come true.</p>

<p>Richardson is off &amp; I am sorry that as he will only be<lb/>
one day in town he will not be able to look you up, tho' he took<lb/>
your <del>tel</del> <hi rend="superscript">No</hi> in case there may be a chance later.  I think<lb/>
his wife who lives at 18 Park Avenue <unclear>Bidford</unclear> &amp; who often comes<lb/>
up to town (!) would <del>probably</del> be glad to see you, but probably<lb/>
not till after he returns.</p>

<p>I wonder if Rex's old place in the New Forest would<lb/>
do for us.  I'm not quite sure of the address but think it<lb/>
was <unclear>Mrs</unclear> Olding. Olding's farm Redlynch near Downton<lb/>
Wiltshire.  It is a delightful part of the country &amp; a comfortable <lb/>
farm.  It might be worth writing (?) &amp; if you do so don't<lb/>
forget to enquire the best means of getting there.  I'm afraid I am<lb/>
giving a tired little p r a great deal to do &amp; to decide, but as<lb/>
she knows the but will not mind what she does with him, as<lb/>
long as she ......, she need not worry about troubling<lb/>
unduly in making up her mind.</p>
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="6571" facs="#L1916_2420_img_6571"/>
        
        
           
            <p>I see that Lloyd George's speech<lb/>
makes it quite plain that he<lb/>
does not expect the war to finish in less that 1 year &amp; that<lb/>
Redmond is beginning to show his teeth more in the open. I retract<lb/>
anything I have said about his possibly being an honest patriot.</p>

<p>Squiffy will try to put things off again on hearing his master's voice<lb/>
but I have some faint hope that this may prove too much for L G <lb/>
&amp; that the former may have to go but I'm afraid this is too<lb/>
good to be true &amp; there is always <del>the</del> his £9000 or £10000 to think<lb/>
of.  If I were a millionaire I think I would pension him off<lb/>
for the sake of the country tho' few men ( or women ) deserve it<lb/>
less.</p>

<p>I don't like your being so tired now writing me letters, I<lb/>
quite understand about the times.  All I mean to say is that<lb/>
if you have anything urgent for the post it is best to post it<lb/>
a good deal earlier in the afternoon is possible but I don't want<lb/>
you to worry about the letters for me any more than you<lb/>
want me to do for you.</p>
 
<p>The place I was at in the trenches was heavily shelled just<lb/>
after I left ( ? my motor) but no one was hurt &amp; the village itself<lb/>
was past hurting.  News of a big French victory ( at any rate <lb/>
it sounds like a bit victory with 1200 prisoners ) has just come in.<lb/>
It is very necessary that the French should get encouragement just now</p>

<p>My dear love to the family &amp; best Xmas wishes!!</p>
