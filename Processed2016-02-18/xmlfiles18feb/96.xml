                            <p>Letter from Paddy Guinness to Cesca Chenevix Trench (an Anglo-Irish woman who adopted Irish identity and took an Irish name Sadhbh Trinseac).

                            <p>Cesca Chevenix Trench, illustrator, was an Anglo-Irish member of the Gaelic League who took an Irish identity and changed her name to Sadhbh Trinseach. Her three brothers enlisted with the British Army in 1914 with her closest brother, Reggie (1888-1918), gazetted to the Sherwood Foresters. Trench served in the Stephen's Green garrison during the Rising, later writing that the Rising had been a 'tragic mistake.' Trench later married Diarmuid Coffey on 17 April 1918. Cesca would perish, like so many others, from the virulent Spanish Flu in October 1918.</p>

this case __________
perhaps you would be good eno' to assure me that the confusion created in my mind by your communication has no real cause. I <del>observe</del> conclude from it that you are unacquainted with the language of this country &amp; of which your name proclaims you in no uncertain voice to be a native. <del>in no uncertain voice</del>. These two <del>seeming</del> contradictory facts force me to the conclusion that I have mistaken the identity of the person I am addressing.

            <lb/>the said window. You <sic>shd</sic> then face

<lb/>discretion &amp; and the <add>military</add> strategical know
<lb/>-ledge you will have acquired

<lb/><del>In</del> The circumscribed place at my

<lb/>to transfer my invitation<lb/>
<lb/>to <sic>yr</sic> namesake together with
<lb/>the expression of my profound

<p>In conclusion may I urge upon you
<lb/>the consideration that as
<lb/>Mr Diarmuid o Cobhthaigh's
<lb/>position as Sec: of the National
<lb/>Volunteers, did not in his
<lb/>opinion absolve him from
<lb/>the necessity of <del>sp</del> using

<lb/>position doubtless most
<lb/>creditable,  tho' unknown to
<lb/>me does not absolve you.</p>
