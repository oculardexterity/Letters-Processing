                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (n√©e Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

Dear Lady Clonbrock,
We have just received a letter, of which I enclose you a copy, from the Major of the Connaught Rangers in Mesopotamia. They seem very pleased indeed with their parcels, and I see from <del>deleted text</del>our enclosed forms, which they return, that they all arrived on the 12th July.
I hope you are keeping well and Lord Clonbrock also. It was a great disappointment to me to see so little of you when you were in town, but the Association now takes all my time, and I never see my friends, even those who are living in London.
Yours very sincerely,
Henrietta MacDonnell

<salute>Dear Lady Clonbrock,</salute>
<p>We have just received a
<lb/> letter, of which I enclose you a copy, from 
<lb/>the Major of the Connaught Rangers in Mesopo&#x2014;
<lb/>tamia. They seem very pleased indeed with
<lb/> their parcels, and I see from <del>the</del> <add>our</add> enclosed
<lb/> forms, which they return, that they all
<lb/> arrived on the 12th. July.</p>
<p>I hope you are keeping well and Lord
<lb/> Clonbrock also. It was a great disappointment
<lb/> to me to see so little of you when you were
<lb/> in town, but the Association now takes all my
<lb/> time, and I never see my friends, even those
<lb/> who are living in London.</p>
<salute>Yours very sincerely,</salute>
