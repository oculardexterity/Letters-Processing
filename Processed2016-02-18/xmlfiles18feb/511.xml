                            <p>This is one of two surviving copies of a letter written by Fr F.M. Ryan to George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951). The letter was written while Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Fr Ryan writes to Gavan Duffy that Casement had come to him after his arrival in Ireland and told him that he was trying to stop the planned rebellion.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>George Gavan Duffy was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising. A campaign was launched featuring many prominent figures such as W.B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw to secure a reprieve for Casement but he was hanged on 3 August 1916.</p>

Roscrea,
Co. Tipperary.
July 12th 1916.

Dear Mr. Gavan Duffy : -

Sir Roger Casement saw me in Tralee on the 21st of April and told me had had come to Ireland to stop the rebellion then impending. He asked me to conceal his identity as well as his object in coming until he should have left Tralee, lest any attempt should be made to rescue him. On the other hand he was very anxious that I should spread the news broadcast after he had left.

Sincerely Yours, 
F. M. Ryan, O. P.

<salute>Dear Mr. Gavan Duffy : -</salute></opener>

<p>Sir Roger Casement saw me in Tralee on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of
<lb/> April and told me had had come to Ireland to stop the
<lb/> rebellion then impending. He asked me to conceal his
<lb/> identity as well as his object in coming until he should
<lb/> have left Tralee, lest any attempt should be made to
<lb/> rescue him. On the other hand he was very anxious that
<lb/> I should spread the news broadcast after he had left.</p>
<closer><salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
