                            <p>Letter from John French, 1st Earl of Ypres (1852-1925) to Sir John Maxwell (1859-1929). Referring to Maxwell's letter of 1 May, French notes with pleasure the progress of events in Ireland but expresses caution where it comes to the 'disposal' of the 'Sinn Féiners' (the British used this term to describe militant nationalists although Sinn Féin were not involved in the Rising) who are not to be severely punished. French expresses surprise at the 'comparatively small amount of damage in Dublin' and refers in detail to the executions of the leaders, the first three of whom had been shot that morning, and the sentence to Countess Constance Markievicz (1868-1927), who fought under Michael Mallin during the Rising but whose death sentence was later commuted on account of her gender. French also writes that he has communicated Maxwell's messages to the King and has asked for a word of congratulation to Maxwell and the troops and mentions that he has arranged for Maxwell to be appointed G.O.C. (General Officer Commanding) in Ireland with the rank of General.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir John Henry Grenfell Maxwell was appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising. Before 1916, Maxwell briefly held command of British troops in Egypt, where he successfully organised defences against a Turkish attack in February 1915 and presided over the huge expansion of his command as Egypt became a major British imperial military base. In March 1916, having been superseded as general officer commanding in Egypt, he was recalled home when the Easter Rising broke out. Sir John Denton Pinkstone French, first Earl of Ypres, was a British officer. Upon the outbreak of war, French was appointed Field Marshal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Although popular with his men, the failure of his offensives, Neuve-Chapelle and Loos, to break the German lines and his criticism of the home government led to his replacement as Field Marshal by sir Douglas Haig (1861-1928) in late 1915. French was appointed Commander in Chief of the Home forces in January 1916.</p>

<lb/> to be severely punished. We shall
<lb/> have to think carefully before we
<lb/> mix them up with Troops in the field.</p>

<salute>My Dear Maxwell,</salute></opener>
<p>Your letter of May 1 - We are
<lb/> all very pleased with the 
<lb/> progress of events in Ireland
<lb/>. I must agree with all you
<lb/> say, except with the disposal of
<lb/> these Sinn Féiners who are not
<lb/> to be severely punished. We shall
<lb/> have to think carefully before we
<lb/> mix them up with Troops in the field.</p>
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="1924" facs="#L1916_701_img_1924"/>
        
        
           
            <p>As regards the Countess Markievicz
<lb/> I have put the matter before the PM 
<lb/> and am now awaiting his decision
<lb/> which will be wired to you at once.
<lb/> Personally I agree with you - she might
<lb/> be shot.</p>
<p>I sent Middleton over at the particular
<lb/> request of the PM. He came to see me
<lb/> this morning on his return. He
<lb/> hasn't done much harm and
<lb/> may be of assistance when the
<lb/> whole thing is thrashed out in Parliament.
<lb/> You shouldn't fear any political or

            <lb/>other interference if I can possibly
<lb/> help it.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the comparatively
<lb/> small amounts of damage in
<lb/> Dublin.</p>
<p>I have communicated your
<lb/> messages to the King and have
<lb/> asked His Majesty to send a
<lb/> wire of congratulation to you
<lb/> and the Troops. You well deserve
<lb/> it.</p>
<p>As regards your own position I
        
    
         
        <pb n="1926" facs="#L1916_701_img_1926"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>have arranged with the  G S that
<lb/> you are to be G.O.C.in C.Ireland
<lb/> and are to have the Military
<lb/> rank of General.</p>
<p>As regards your wire reporting
<lb/> the Trial &amp; Execution of the 3
<lb/> rebel leaders and the punishment
<lb/> awarded to 3 others it is the
<lb/> PM's intention to announce this
<lb/> at once in the H of C and then
<lb/> the press can publish the news.
<lb/>The PM expressed himself as
        
    
         
        <pb n="1927" facs="#L1916_701_img_1927"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/><lb/>"Impressed" at the
<lb/> rapidity of the trial &amp; sentences.</p>
<pb/>I pointed out that you were
<lb/> carrying out your instructions
<lb/> exactly &amp; correctly and in
<lb/> strict accordance with Military
<lb/> and Martial law. He quite
<lb/> understands but asked me to
<lb/> <del>wern</del> warn you not to <del>have</del> give the
<lb/> impression that <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the Sinn Feiners
<lb/> would suffer death. I told him
<lb/> that the fact of 3 of them
        
    
         
        <pb n="1928" facs="#L1916_701_img_1928"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>having been awarded a much
<lb/> less severe sentence was evidence
<lb/> enough of the attitude you were
<lb/> adopting towards them and that
<lb/> I thought it much better to
<lb/> leave you alone to your own
<lb/> discretion. He agreed to this.
<lb/><unclear>I will tell you</unclear> what passed. </p>
