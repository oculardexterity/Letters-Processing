                            <p>A letter from J.J. Hanna on behalf of John Redmond MP (1856-1918) to Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). Mabel was active in attempting to secure her husband's release and Hanna writes that Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, is unable at present to do anything for individual prisoners but would do all in his power for her husband when it became possible in the future.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

Dear Mrs.Fitzgerald,
Mr.Redmond desires me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd. inst., and, in reply, to state that he would be very glad to do anything in his power for your husband, but that this is not a case of getting a release, but an amnesty, and that, after a little while, he sincerely hopes that circumstances will be such as to necessitate a general amnesty. It would be quite impossible, however, to obtain a reconsideration of the sentance passed in individual cases, as yet. When the proper time comes, however, you may rely upon Mr.Redmond doing everything in his power for your husband.
Yours very truly,
J.J.Hanna

Mrs.Mabelle Fitzgerald.

<salute>Dear Mrs.Fitzgerald,</salute></opener>
<p>Mr.Redmond desires me to acknowledge the receipt
<lb/> of your letter of the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>. inst., and, in reply, to state
<lb/> that he would be very glad to do anything in his power for
<lb/> your husband, but <add>that</add> this is not a case of getting a <hi rend="underline">release</hi>,
<lb/> but <add>an</add> <hi rend="underline">amnesty</hi>, and that, after a little while, he sincerely
<lb/> hopes that circumstances will be such as to necessitate
<lb/> a general amnesty. It would be quite impossible, however,
<lb/> to obtain a reconsideration of the sentence passed
<lb/> in individual cases, as yet. When the proper time comes,
<lb/> however, you may rely upon Mr.Redmond doing everything
<lb/> in his power for your husband.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours very truly,</salute>
