                            <p>The letter is a facsimile copy of a letter written by Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). By the time this letter was written, Casement had been marginalized by the Rising's planners and his relations with the Germans had become strained as he felt they were not willing to offer enough assistance. In the letter, he complains that he is in a 'dreadful situation'. If he goes (presumably to Ireland) he would end up as a convict, a fate worse than death', but if he stays he would be considered a coward. By the end of the letter, he suggests that the only way out is 'death', reflected of his often depressed state at this time.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>He spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. Casement succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Casement had returned to Ireland with the hope of preventing the Rising but was arrested after he landed in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. He was hanged in London in August 1916.</p>
