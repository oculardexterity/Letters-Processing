                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968). This letter mainly consists of Wilfrid's declarations of affection for Lillian, as he alludes to the 'pink paw marks' he looks forward to finding on his letters. This refers to Wilfrid's pet-name for Lillian, 'P.R.', which appears to stand for 'Pink Rabbit'. His own pet-name is 'B.W.', or 'Brown Wolf'. Wilfrid also takes pleasure in the idea of the censor reading his words to Lillian. He finishes the letter with the news that Germany is willing to give up Alsace-Lorraine and an indemnity to France as part of a possible peace, but states that he is not optimistic.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender (1876 - 1960) was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<salute>My P R</salute></opener>

<p>Only a scrap with my <unclear>folks</unclear> letter
<lb/>as I am soon bound for my rabbit &#x2014;
<lb/>protected hole where I intend to pass the 
<lb/>night &amp; to remain part of tomorrow.</p>

<p>It is uncertain where I shall be tomorrow
<lb/>evening but I am fairly certain not to
<lb/>be able to write for a couple of days now</p>

<p>It was a great joy to get 4 letters
<lb/><hi rend="underline">of course</hi> rather a disappointment that
<lb/>there were pink paw marks!  I think of you now
<lb/>poor p r with <unclear>Mr V</unclear> &amp; do hope you
<lb/>won't get a fearful head before you move
<lb/>nor be tired out by the move.  I agree that
<lb/>your partner is having a very easy time in
<lb/>the move.  I hope she doesn't let you be the maid
<lb/>of all work.  Most kind of Uncle Gay give him

            <lb/>my warm thanks. Terrific <unclear>glaring</unclear> almost<lb/>
hols for the <unclear>pit mates</unclear> !  All the same when<lb/>
the p r is taking a little relaxation  the b w wishes<lb/>
her to do it comfortably.   Great growls at next<lb/>
page in this letter.  The p r 's <unclear>white</unclear> imagination<lb/>
would have pink wolf pawmarks about if it<lb/>
were possible.  You may well blush at the<lb/>
censor reading this but I am not responsible<lb/>
What a pity Mr Bain doesn't now censor<lb/>
your letters.</p>

<p>All kinds of optimistic reports about<lb/>
including that Germany has offered Alsace<lb/>
Lorraine &amp; an indemnity to France!  Next<lb/>
she will be offering Hamburg to England in a <lb/>
few days or something equally wild <hi rend="underline">if</hi> we<lb/>
have any success at all.  I don't like optimistism<lb/>
now.</p>
