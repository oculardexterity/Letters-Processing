                            <p>The letter is from land agitator and politician Laurence Ginnell (1852-1953) to Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). Ginnell writes to ensure Mabel that while the executions of the leaders are occupying peoples' minds at present, those who are imprisoned would not be forgotten and a general amnesty would be called for soon. He states that he would not forget someone whom The O'Rahilly held in the highest esteem. Michael Joseph O'Rahilly (1875-1916) and Fitzgerald had both originally been in support of attempts to stop the Rising taking place but both joined in once it had started. O'Rahilly was killed in Moore Lane on Thursday of Easter week and Ginnell writes that he is 'heartbroken' about his death.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Laurence Ginnell was an Irish nationalist politician, lawyer, and member of parliament. He initially ran as a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party, but, from 1910 onward he ran as an Independent Nationalist. Mabel Fitzgerald was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mrs Fitzgerald,</salute></opener>
<p>Needless to say you have my deepest
<lb/> sympathy.  It is only extreme pressure of work
<lb/> that has prevented my writing to you before now.</p>
<p>But do not think for a moment
<lb/> that Mr Fitzgerald is going to be forgotten.
<lb/> Oh no.  We are not that bad.  As you say,
<lb/> the executions fill people's minds for the time.
<lb/>  But of course we will demand a general
<lb/> amnesty very soon.  I at all events am
<lb/> not going to forget one of whom  The O'Rahilly
<lb/> entertained the highest admiration.  I loved
<lb/> The O'Rahilly, am heartbroken that he is no more,
<lb/> and will certainly leave no stone unturned to
<lb/> get his friend Desmond Fitzgerald released.
<lb/>  So please have good courage.</p>
<p>I was speaking to your husband's brother last
<lb/> Saturday evening.  In haste.</p>
<closer><salute>Sincerely yours</salute>
