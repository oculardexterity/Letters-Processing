                            <p>Letter from Charles Wyndham Wynne (1895-1917) to his mother, Alice Katherine Wynne (1833-1928). Charles writes from Belfast, explaining that he was conducting a recruitment draft near Belfast, and had some free time in that city. He writes that it would have been nice to know somebody in Belfast, yet he enjoyed his time there regardless. Charles closes rather critically, questioning whether his mother 'look[s] forward to getting my letters at all?? I sometimes wonder!'</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Charles Wynne served as a captain in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. His application to the Royal Flying Corps was denied in 1916 due to his poor eyesight. Charles ultimately died of wounds received at Armentieres, June 1917.</p>

Dear Mother 
I have at last had a bit of luck as I have been conducting a draft from Lenan to Grey Point (Belfast Lough) and have got a day here! The draft is safely landed at Grey pt. so now I'm free. I thought of coming down to Glendalough but I am hoping for proper leave soon and that being so I thought it hardly

worth while for the few hours between trains tomorrow.
I had great luck as today was a glorious day and yet not too hot for marching (here is about 8 miles from Lenan to railway station Clonmany) I arrived at Grey Pt. about 7.30 just in time to have dinner. They were a particularly nice set. A civil doctor and <sic>too</sic>subalterns. One of them was going into Belfast so I started with him - we missed the train so he motored me in - a very nice little run - I am very delighted to have left the Swilly behind if only for the day and I haven't to return till Wednesday.
It's a pity I don't know anyone in Belfast.
Please thank Win for her letter. Its grand the <gap/>seem to be going.

enclosed! He won't mind will he - I put it very tastefully.
Now it's getting fairly late so I think I'll roll off to bed. (I don't of course mean to suggest that I've drink taken)
Belfast seems quite a decent sort of hole.
Well goodnight, dear Mother.
Very much love to all.

I wonder does Father get out this topping weather - I do hope so.
Do you look forward to getting my letters at all?? I sometimes wonder!!

<lb/> been conducting a draft
<lb/> from Lenan to Grey Point
<lb/> (Belfast Lough) and have got
<lb/> a day here! The draft is
<lb/> safely landed at Grey pt.

<lb/> of coming down to Glendalough

<lb/> leave soon and that
<lb/> being so I thought it hardly

<p>I had great luck as today 
<lb/> was a glorious day and yet 
<lb/> not too hot for marching 
<lb/> (here is about 8 miles from 
<lb/> Lenan to railway station 
<lb/> Clonmany) I arrived at 
<lb/> Grey Pt. about 7.30 just in 
<lb/> time to have dinner. They were 
<lb/> a particularly nice set. A 
<lb/>civil doctor and <sic>too</sic>subalterns. 
<lb/>One of them was going 
<lb/>into Belfast so I started 
<pb/>
<lb/>with him &#x2014; we missed the 
<lb/>train so he motored me 
<lb/>in &#x2014; a very nice little 
<lb/>run &#x2014; I am very 
<lb/>delighted to have left the 
<lb/>Swilly behind if only for 
<lb/>the day and I haven't 
<lb/>to return till Wednesday.
<lb/>It's a pity I don't know 
<lb/>anyone in Belfast.</p>

<salute>Dear Mother</salute></opener> 
<p>I have at last had
<lb/> a bit of luck as I have 
<lb/> been conducting a draft
<lb/> from Lenan to Grey Point
<lb/> (Belfast Lough) and have got
<lb/> a day here! The draft is
<lb/> safely landed at Grey pt. 
<lb/> so now I'm free. I thought
<lb/> of coming down to Glendalough
<lb/> but I am hoping for proper 
<lb/> leave soon and that
<lb/> being so I thought it hardly

            <lb/>worth while for the few hours 
<lb/>between trains tomorrow.</p>
<p>I had great luck as today 
<lb/> was a glorious day and yet 
<lb/> not too hot for marching 
<lb/> (here is about 8 miles from 
<lb/> Lenan to railway station 
<lb/> Clonmany) I arrived at 
<lb/> Grey Pt. about 7.30 just in 
<lb/> time to have dinner. They were 
<lb/> a particularly nice set. A 
<lb/>civil doctor and <sic>too</sic>subalterns. 
<lb/>One of them was going 
<lb/>into Belfast so I started 
<pb/>
<lb/>with him &#x2014; we missed the 
<lb/>train so he motored me 
<lb/>in &#x2014; a very nice little 
<lb/>run &#x2014; I am very 
<lb/>delighted to have left the 
<lb/>Swilly behind if only for 
<lb/>the day and I haven't 
<lb/>to return till Wednesday.
<lb/>It's a pity I don't know 
<lb/>anyone in Belfast.</p>
<p>Please thank Win for her 
<lb/>letter. Its grand the <unclear>wives</unclear> 
<lb/>seem to be going.</p>
<p> I sent Oliver's book to 
<lb/>Aunt <unclear>Clara</unclear> and <unclear>loaned</unclear>
<lb/>Paul's book to him; with 
<lb/>a biting criticism of his theory
