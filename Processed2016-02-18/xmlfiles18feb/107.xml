                            <p>A letter to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928) from her niece May.  In the letter, May asks Lady Clonbrock to ensure she will be at home when they make a visit tomorrow. She then refers to a letter sent to by 'Arthur' who was then fighting in France during World War I. May describes the content of the letter and sympathises with Edward's plight, noting that the men are all 'nearly dead with fatigue'. They were marching towards Ypres, many officers had been killed and Edward had been hit with some shrapnel.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (n√©e Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

My darling Aunt Tweegle,

We hope very much to find you and Uncle Gerald at home tomorrow morning about 12 o' clock. So please don't go out and disappoint us!

Eileen has been here, she tells me there has been a letter to Arthur from Edward, written on the 9th. Poor boy, he says it is all too ghastly for words and they are all nearly dead with fatigue those who are left alive. Many of his officers killed and he was hit by shrapnel and his trousers torn and his money in his pocket torn and he was what he calls knocked and at one...

<salute>My darling Aunt Tweegle,</salute></opener>

<p>We hope very much
<lb/> to find you &amp; Uncle Gerald
<lb/> at home tomorrow morning 
<lb/>about 12 o' clock so please
<lb/> don't go out &amp; disappoint 
<lb/>us! Eileen has been here
<lb/>she tells me there has been a
<lb/> letter to Arthur from Edward,
<lb/> written on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Poor boy, he
<lb/> says it is all too ghastly for words
<lb/> &amp;they are all nearly dead with 
<lb/>fatigue those who are left alive
<lb/>. Many of his officers killed &amp;
<lb/> he was hit by shrapnel &amp; his
<lb/> trousers torn &amp; his money in
<lb/> his pocket torn &amp; he was what 
<lb/>he calls knocked and at one

            <lb/>time. They are now marching
<lb/> north he believes to Ypres 
<lb/>where they are going to start
<lb/> fighting now. He says the 
<lb/>men etc. are quite worn
<lb/> out. It is too awful to think 
<lb/>of him only 20 in the midst 
<lb/>of such horrors &amp; terrible 
<lb/>sights. Poor boy. I believe
<lb/> he feels it much. I suppose
<lb/> if they are marching north 
<lb/>they are not fighting just 
<lb/>yet. </p>
