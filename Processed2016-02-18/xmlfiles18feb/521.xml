                            <p>This letter was written in response to E. Blackwell's letter of 2 August, rejecting George Gavan Duffy's (1882-1951) request to attend the execution of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) and the family request for burial outside of the prison. Gavan Duffy argues that execution for treason is different from that for murder and the requirement for burial within the prison is not therefore not valid.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>George Gavan Duffy was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising.</p>

I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of yesterday intimating that the Secretary of State is unable to allow me to be present at the execution of Roger Casement and that he is unable to allow the body to be buried outside the prison walls "as the law requires that it shall be buried within the walls".
I beg you to let me know to what law you refer, as I venture to think there must be a misapprehension, for I am advised that there is no such law in the case of treason and if the Secretary of State will be good enough to reconsider the matter I feel sure that he will recognise that the King has the disposal of the body in his hands. If this be so, I hesitate to believe that His Majesty will be advised to refuse the relatives' request to have the body in order that Roger Casement may not be buried with the indignity habitual in the case of a murderer.
I write in great haste and beg for the favour of your reply as soon as possible.
In the meantime I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
G.Gavan Duffy

<salute>Sir :-</salute></opener>
<lb/>311643:-
<p>I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of yesterday
<lb/> intimating that the Secretary of State is unable to allow
<lb/> me to be present at the execution of Roger Casement and that he
<lb/> is unable to allow the body to be buried outside the prison walls
<lb/> "as the law requires that it shall be buried within the walls".
<lb/>I beg you to let me know to what law you refer, as I venture to
<lb/> think there must be a misapprehension, for I am advised that
<lb/> there is no such law in the case of treason and if the Secretary
<lb/> of State will be good enough to reconsider the matter I feel
<lb/> sure that he will recognise that the King has the disposal of
<lb/> the body in his hands. If this be so, I hesitate to believe that
<lb/> His Majesty will be advised to refuse the relatives' request
<lb/> to have the body in order that Roger Casement may not be buried
<lb/> with the indignity habitual in the case of a murderer.</p>
<p>I write in great haste and beg for the favour of your
<lb/> reply as soon as possible.</p>
<closer><salute>In the meantime I have the honour to be,
<lb/>Sir,
<lb/>Your obedient servant,</salute>
<signed>G.Gavan Duffy</signed></closer>
