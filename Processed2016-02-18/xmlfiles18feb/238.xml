                            <p>A letter from Lady MacDonnell of the Irish Women's Association to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). The letter includes a list of Christmas 1916 parcel items that will be dispatched to the 1st and 2nd Batallions of the Connaught Rangers attached to the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force by the Co. Galway Military and Naval Committee. MacDonnell laments that what she considered the best item, 'Soup Rolls,'  which the men serving on the Western Front greatly appreciated, were substituted out. She hopes that Lady Clonbrock will approve of her amendments to the package.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

Dear Lady Clonbrook,
Strangely enough, I was yesterday morning dictating a letter for you when I was interrupted by most urgent business connected with this next Scheme for the P. of W. which the Govt. is starting. During my absence, your letter came - but I got back here so late that I was unable to answer your letter - and when I got home, I was too tired to do any thing but go to bed. I was writing yesterday with intention of sending you<pb/>

I was writing yesterday with intention of sending you<pb/>

Dear Lady Clonbrook,
Strangely enough, I was yesterday morning dictating a letter for you when I was interrupted by most urgent business connected with this next Scheme for the P. of W. which the Govt. is starting. During my absence, your letter came - but I got back here so late that I was unable to answer your letter - and when I got home, I was too tired to do any thing but go to bed. I was writing yesterday with intention of sending you<pb/>

<salute>Dear Lady Clonbrook,</salute>
<p>Strangely 
<lb/>enough, I was yesterday morning 
<lb/>dictating a letter for you when 
<lb/>I was interrupted by most 
<lb/>urgent business connected with 
<lb/>this next Scheme for the P. of W. 
<lb/>which the Govt. is starting. 
<lb/>During my absence, your 
<lb/>letter came &#x2014; but I got back 
<lb/>here so late that I was 
<lb/>unable to answer your 
<lb/>letter &#x2014; &amp; when I got home, 
<lb/>I was too tired to do any 
<lb/>thing but go to bed.</p> 
<p>I was writing yesterday with 
<lb/>the intention of sending you

            <lb/>the single copy of what had been sent 
<lb/>to the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> C.G. in Mesopotamia.</p> 
<p>I didn't wait for the <gap/>, as my 
<lb/>people disappointed me as to the date 
<lb/>of their arrival &amp; substituted what 
<lb/>I consider the best thing we have for 
<lb/>cold &amp; weary men &#x2014; namely some quite 
<lb/>delicious "Soup Rolls". I know our men 
<lb/>in Flanders love that. It's called Pea 
<lb/>Soup &amp; Bacon! &amp; is warm and comforting, 
<lb/>though not as "Christmassy" as sweets. 
<lb/>I hope you will think I did right. 
<lb/>I was so anxious to get our things off 
<lb/>by the 16th, that I didn't wait for the 
<lb/>sweets.</p>
<p>The W.O. told me by Novr. 1st 
<lb/>but <hi rend="underline">I know</hi> it is better to send off a 
<lb/>fortnight earlier, &amp; I am thankful to say 
<lb/>our whole 37 bales or cases went off 
<lb/>on 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. </p>
<p>We had some socks ready to send but your 
<lb/>Co. Galway contribution was so magnificent

            <lb/>that <unclear>I have</unclear> kept ours for 
<lb/>a little later. Indeed I 
<lb/>doubt if the P.O. at 
<lb/>Avonmouth would accept 
<lb/>any more packages for
<lb/>me. <unclear>Request</unclear> <hi rend="underline">over 18

<p>I wish I could see their joy 
<lb/>when that consignment 
<lb/>arrives! &#x2014; In case you 
<lb/>would like to <del>have it</del> <add>know</add> &amp;
<lb/>not because I want the 
<lb/>money! I enclose a rough 
<lb/>memo of the cost the 
<lb/>freight to Avonmouth (our 
<lb/>new port for Mesopotamia) 
<lb/>I cannot yet tell, as the 
<lb/>weekly Cashier's bill is not 
<lb/>yet in, so please don't send

            <lb/>any money yet. </p>
<p>This new W. O. scheme is going to give 
<lb/>us a great deal of extra work at first
<lb/>&#x2014; but I have no fear for the future. 
<lb/>I am confident we shall always get 
<lb/>the money we require. &#x2014; The new W.O. 
<lb/>Committee is very friendly &amp; very 
<lb/>complimentary to us &#x2014; &amp; I think the 
<lb/>extra trouble is well worth <del>the <gap/> 
<lb/>in</del> going through, for there was a 
<lb/>hideous amount of overlapping, &amp; a 
<lb/>woeful amount of carelessness or 
<lb/>ignorance on the part of many Committees 
<lb/>who should have known better.
<lb/>Our expenses will be on record &#x2014; but 
<lb/>as I have already said, I don't feel 
<lb/>any doubt as to our being able to 
<lb/>keep up to it for our friends are 
<lb/>very good to us.</p>  
<p>Forgive this badly written letter

<p>I sent "broken" quantities of some things 
<lb/>(for instance, of plum pudding) on account 
<lb/>of the packing &#x2014; I really didn't have

<p>That's why I didn't spend the £80 I
