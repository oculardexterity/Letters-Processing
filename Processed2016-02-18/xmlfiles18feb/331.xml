Dear Nora
I have not received any reply to the letter I sent you last week. I have not got any word of what they are going to do with me yet. I had filled in a form saying I had nothing to do with the trouble and referred them to the Engineer to show I was working. He will have the Doctor's Certificate that I was sick on Tuesday& Wednesday, and this ought be proof enough for anyone. I expect the form will be sent to Dublin and I suppose as soon as they certify the statement I will probably be released. The form has now been filled in a week so the reply should be here any time. I understand I will be

Is May still at her music & is Robert still going to school? Where are you stopping? I have seen a great lot of people here from Dublin. There is one old chap I knew who has only one eye & he has been shoved over here too.
We will have great times when we get back. I want you to keep some of the papers with an account of what happened as I don't know yet who was killed or injured (do not send).
Who has taken up my job in Kingstown?
How are Jem & Annie. Is Jem better?
There is no use of you sending me anything here. But I think you might have a look round for a small shop, as I don't think I will stop in the job anyhow. Tell everyone I was asking for them. I am in the best of health. I will close with a note for Bob & Jem.

<p>I have not received any reply to the

<lb/> any word of what they are going to do
<lb/> with me yet. I had filled in a form
<lb/> saying I had nothing to do with the trouble

<lb/> I was working. He will have the Doctor's
<lb/> Certificate that I was sick on Tuesday &amp;

<lb/> will be sent to Dublin and I suppose

<salute>Dear Nora</salute></opener>
<p>I have not received any reply to the
<lb/> letter I sent you last week. I have not got
<lb/> any word of what they are going to do
<lb/> with me yet. I had filled in a form
<lb/> saying I had nothing to do with the trouble
<lb/> and referred them to the Engineer to show
<lb/> I was working. He will have the Doctor's
<lb/> Certificate that I was sick on Tuesday &amp;
<lb/> Wednesday, and this ought be proof
<lb/> enough for anyone. I expect the form
<lb/> will be sent to Dublin and I suppose
<lb/> as soon as they certify the statement I will
<lb/> probably be released. The form has now been
<lb/> filled in a week so the reply should be
<lb/> here any time. I understand I will be

            <lb/>allowed to send one letter a week. Let me
<lb/> hear from you as soon as you can.
<lb/>Is May still at her music &amp; is Robert
<lb/> still going to school? Where are you stopping? I have
<lb/> seen a great lot of people here from Dublin.
<lb/> There is one old chap I knew who has only
<lb/> one eye &amp; he has been shoved over here too.
<lb/> We will have great times when we get
<lb/> back. I want you to keep some of the papers
<lb/> with an account of what happened as I
<lb/> don't know yet who was killed or injured <add>(do not send).</add>them.
<lb/> who has taken up my job in Kingstown?
<lb/> How are Jem &amp; Annie. Is Jem better?
<lb/>There is no use of you sending me anything
<lb/> here. But I think you might have a look
<lb/> round for a small shop, as I don't think
<lb/> I will stop in the job anyhow. Tell everyone
<lb/> I was asking for them. I am in the best of
<lb/> health. I will close with a note for Bob &amp; Jem.

<lb/>BOB AND JEM
<lb/> I WILL SOON BE COMING
<lb/> HOME ON THE MAIL BOAT
<lb/> DADDY
<lb/>Write to me &amp; I will reply as soon as I can.
