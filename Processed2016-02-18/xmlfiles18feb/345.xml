                            <p>A letter written by Wesley Hanna for his family in Limerick, and a sister, Frances, in Montevideo, Uruguay. The letter was passed around members of the family and Hanna included the instruction to 'pass round quickly please'. It describes events witnessed by Hanna in Dublin from 8.30pm on Tuesday, 27 April 1916, when he arrived in Dublin from Limerick, and the following Sunday, 2 July (3 July is written on the letter). The Easter Rising had broken out in Dublin the day before Hanna's arrival.  The letter is representative of much of the confusion and gossip circulating in Dublin during the Rising. Hanna, for example, states that Roger Casement had already been brought to London and shot when he was, in fact, hanged in London in August but correctly notes that James Connolly (a 'Larkinite') was wounded. It also reflects the initially negative reaction among the general public to the Rising. Hanna describes the death of a child, destruction around the city and food shortages. He refers to the rebels ('S.F.' throughout the letter: the Rising was incorrectly described as a Sinn Féin rebellion) as 'those who caused all the sorrow and the loss’ and later as ‘poor deluded fools’ who would pay a ‘heavy price for their folly’. The letter finishes at 9pm on Sunday, 2 July. The leaders of the Rising had agreed to an unconditional surrender on 2 July. A number of the garrison leaders did not surrender until the following morning and sporadic fighting was still ongoing as Hanna finished his letter. The enclosures include a photograph of Victor E. Hanna, brother of the letter writer.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Wesley Fletcher Hanna was one of fourteen children of Robert and Emily Hanna. Hanna, a Methodist, worked as an accountant for Switzers in Limerick.

Dear friends, 
I amy as well write but whether you will get the letter soon or not is a mystery. Such goings on! We reached Dublin at 8:30 on Tuesday eve to find Kingsbridge in the hands of the military, and passed out between 2 lines of men with fixed bayonets! The train came in at the arrival platform which made us very suspicious but we little knew what was to come. Outside all darkness - no trams or cars of any description of course and no one to give any information as to what was going on anywhere - about 700 or so got out of our train, some for cross channel most for Dublin so we looked round in wonderment - Quay  at Guinness's side held by fixed bayonets - the Kingsbridge ditto but they let us pass one way. I thought I might get a corner in Ross's but it was crammed to the doors, not even a chair left - so I slung in my bag and asked Mr R to keep it until I could send for it. Then I started to walk home - [Lo Jo]! "Halt - who goes there? at every blessed

Tried Mr Boyd first and found them quite free, having 4 beds to spare and so I gratefully left them my big umbrella, Crombie hat &c while I went back for my bag! All this time there was continuous popping of rifles in the distance. It was absolutely impossible to face the Quays or you risked being shot at sight!

All this while I haven't said anything of the beginning because I don't know it. The Liberty Hall (Larkin's men) appear to have seized the G.P.O. first of all and the other points were quickly seized by S.F. Well to continue - we went to rest, rifle fire still going on and some heavy gunfire also. Wednesday morning - no telephones available, no train back home for the day so I fortunately collared a Rly porter and scribbled a note to Mr Wilson to ask him to get his Limerick folk to communicate with you and stop Mona coming up for a while - I, of course, don't know whether this has gone through or not! As I was parleying with this porter up came one of Switzers girls who was pretty well upset thro inability to get home since the night before. Had left Midleton 2.30 on Monday and got as far as the Junction same day. Then turned back to Cork again and spent the night in a Rly carriage. Came up on

Finally, in desperation, she with 5 others had entreated a housekeeper to give them if only a covering for the night and were brought in and given supper, beds - 3 on the floor - (they slept in their clothes) and breakfast. When I met her she was absolutely "at sea", so I proposed that if she liked to try in my company we would endeavour to get round the city and so we started on a 6 mile walk - eventually landing at her door at 1pm. to her great delight and undisguised relief. Then I sailed on to Mrs Nelson's and gave her all the Limerick news. She was in a very nervous state as you might expect but seemed much relieved that no trouble had arisen in Limerick or Cork as both places were reported as very much disturbed indeed. At 2.30 I restarted my journey homeward taking my usual route - Bless you! soldiers hundreds of them on the march from Kingstown along Morehampton

Then I went on through Herbert Park where I stopped for a word or two with Mrs Fannin - then on again to find Ballsbridge held by the military and a fairly smart fusillade in progress - 4 soldiers shot dead there during the morning! So I had to turn again and go out through Donnybrook and along by the Dodder and so home without any mishap at 4.30! much to Mrs Richard's surprise. 

I had a good wash, some tea and then strolled out to Mr Moore's place to ask about business [ engagements? ]. Stayed there about 1 1/2 hours and then home. 

Steady firing going on all the time - This morning more military in from Kingstown - full brigade all departments. Engineers, RAMC, Chaplains &c. &c. several batteries of artillery and a new gun

I got so far on Thursday night - It is now Saturday and I could write a book with what I've seen and heard since. The trouble is I don't know where to begin! Firing is going on constantly all the time - up to tonight we have had none near us but tonight! Some S.F. chap had got into the second house in the avenue up near the tramlines you know, and fired at a soldier wounding him. Then the fun (?) began and the place was alive with the firing all round for quite 10 minutes - then the end - they got him dead! Really it is awful to think of! About half an hour or so after that there was some desultory  firing and smack came a bullet against next door house. I skipped you

The house at the corner was held by the S.F. party with a machine gun and the soldiers were at Ballsbridge so you can imagine what a hot spot it was for 3 days until 14 dead S.F. rebels  were accounted for and the house taken.

Sunday night - I got so far yesterday and now for today and since. When I finished writing  last evg and was reading a bit there started a regular fusillade of shots up at the end of the Avenue on the tramline end - some chap was spotted somewhere and they blazed away I suppose about 200 shots in about 2 minutes - don't know whether they got him or not. Then last night - or rather this morning - there was tremendous shooting round about us and I heard this morning that the military were searching the gardens round about here. This afternoon they started "Shelling" a house in the avenue.

There were no Church services in the City today so far as I know. I went down to Sandymount to see if there was any there and found that if the people came, there would be - a very goodly number turned out and we had a quiet time. I never heard the Lord's Prayer followed so earnestly before. Mr McKeag was the preacher and his address was most apropos. I enclose a map on which I mark all the places that I have heard of so far in red ink - the read line from Parkgate St to Serpentine Ave represents my walk on Wednesday - I hear they are going to search the houses round here any time now so we are quite prepared for all sorts of inquisitions - I wish it was over and done with so that we might get

<salute>Dear friends,</salute> 
I may as well write but whether you will get<lb/> the letter soon or not is a mystery. Such goings on!<lb/> We reached Dublin at 8:30 on Tuesday eve to find<lb/> Kingsbridge in the hands of the military, and passed out<lb/> between 2 lines of men with fixed bayonets! The train<lb/> came in at the arrival platform which made us very<lb/> suspicious but we little knew what was to come. Outside<lb/> all darkness - no trams or cars of any description of<lb/> course and no one to give any information as to what<lb/> was going on anywhere - about 700 or so got out of<lb/> our train, some for cross channel most for Dublin so we<lb/> looked round in wonderment - Quay  at Guinness's side<lb/> held by fixed bayonets - the Kings bridge ditto but they<lb/> let us pass one way. I thought I might get a corner in<lb/> Ross's but it was crammed to the doors, not even a<lb/> chair left - so I slung in my bag and asked Mr R to<lb/> keep it until I could send for it. Then I started to<lb/> walk home - <gap/> "Halt - who goes there? at every blessed<lb/><pb/>

Finally, in desperation,<lb/> she with 5 others had entreated a housekeeper to give them<lb/> if only a covering for the night and were brought in<lb/> and given supper, beds - 3 on the floor - (they slept in their<lb/> clothes) and breakfast.

Then I sailed over to Mrs Nelson's and gave her<lb/> all the Limerick news.

<lb/> Then I went on through Herbert Park where I stopped for

<lb/> were searching the gardens round about
<lb/> here. This afternoon they started "Shelling"

<salute>Dear friends,</salute></opener> 
<p>I may as well write but whether you will get<lb/> the letter soon or not is a mystery. Such goings on!<lb/> We reached Dublin at 8:30 on Tuesday eve to find<lb/> Kingsbridge in the hands of the military, and passed out<lb/> between 2 lines of men with fixed bayonets! The train<lb/> came in at the arrival platform which made us very<lb/> suspicious but we little knew what was to come. Outside<lb/> all darkness &#x2014; no trams or cars of any description of<lb/> course and no one to give any information as to what<lb/> was going on anywhere. About 700 or so got out of<lb/> our train, some for cross channel most for Dublin so we<lb/> looked round in wonderment. Quay  at Guinness's side<lb/> held by fixed bayonets &#x2014; the Kings bridge ditto but they<lb/> let us pass one way. I thought I might get a corner in<lb/> Ross's but it was crammed to the doors, not even a<lb/> <hi rend="underline">chair</hi> left &#x2014; so I slung in my bag and asked Mr R to<lb/> keep it until I could send for it. Then I started to<lb/> walk home &#x2014; No go! "Halt &#x2014; who goes there? at every blessed<pb/>

<lb/>turn or crossroad and it seemed as if we were en&#x2014;
<lb/>circled with a ring of fixed bayonets. Then I thought of
<lb/> Epworth Tce and faced up to cadge a bed from Rev S. J. Boyd,
<lb/> R Morgan or Dr Smith. Tried Mr Boyd first and found them
<lb/> quite free, having <hi rend="underline">4</hi> beds to spare and so I gratefully left
<lb/> them my big umbrella &amp; <unclear>Carnie</unclear> Hat etc. while I went back for
<lb/> my bag! All this time there was continuous popping of
<lb/> rifles in the distance. It was absolutely impossible to face
<lb/> the Quays or you risked being shot at sight! Dr Smith
<lb/> came in and told us all the news so far which was that
<lb/> S.F. was in possession of <add>Stephen's Green,</add> Westland Row, Custom H<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>,
<lb/> Metropole Hotel, G.P.O., Jacobs, Four Courts, "Daily Express",
<lb/> South Dublin Union and Inchicore - numerous casual&#x2014;
<lb/>ties amongst both parties and several S.F. prisoners
<lb/> in military hands at Arbour Hill Barracks with a few
<lb/> wounded in "George <hi rend="underline">5</hi>" Hospital - lorries flying about
<lb/> &amp;c. He had been through the City and coming home
<lb/> had passed through 5 barricades made by the Sinn Fein
<lb/> men up in Phibsboro road - One of these the Military
<lb/> had blown to bits with a 18/H Shell no less! On top
<lb/> of the shooting, looting had started and Sackville
        
    
         
        <pb n="924" facs="#L1916_345_img_924"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>Street was badly handled &#x2014; Nobletts, Manfields and
<lb/> Lawrences had been completely cleared  out and Law&#x2014;
<lb/>rences was burning fiercely &#x2014; It was eventually burned
<lb/> to the ground. All this while I haven't said anything of the
<lb/> beginning because I don't know it. The Liberty Hall (Larkin's men)
<lb/> appear to have seized the G.P.O. first of all and the other
<lb/> points were quickly seized by S.F. Well to continue &#x2014;
<lb/> we went to rest, rifle fire still going on and some heavy
<lb/> gunfire also. Wednesday morning - no telephones available,
<lb/> no train back home for the day so I fortunately collared a
<lb/> <unclear>railway</unclear> porter and scribbled a note to Mr Wilson to ask him
<lb/> to get his Limerick folk to communicate with you and
<lb/> stop Mona coming up for a while &#x2014; I, of course, don't
<lb/> know whether this has gone through or not. I can only
<lb/> hope it has as I cannot get near <unclear>K.B.</unclear>! As I was parleying
<lb/> with this porter up came one of Switzers girls who was
<lb/> pretty well upset thro inability to get home since the night
<lb/> before. Had left Midleton 2.30 on Monday &amp; got as far as
<lb/> the Junction same day. Then turned back to Cork again
<lb/> and spent the night in a <unclear>railway</unclear> carriage. Came up on
        
    
         
        <pb n="925" facs="#L1916_345_img_925"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>the  same train as I had and had spent nearly two
<lb/> hours looking for a sleeping place. Finally, in desperation,
<lb/> she with 5 others had entreated a housekeeper to give them
<lb/> if only a covering for the night and were brought in
<lb/> and given supper, beds &#x2014; 3 on the floor &#x2014; (they slept in their
<lb/> clothes) and breakfast. When I met her she was absolutely
<lb/> "at sea", so I proposed that if she liked to stay in my com
<lb/>pany we would endeavour to get round the city and so
<lb/> we started on a 6 mile walk. eventually landing at
<lb/> her door at 1pm. to her great delight and undisguised
<lb/> relief. Then I sailed over to Mrs Nelson's and gave her
<lb/> all the Limerick news. She was in a very nervous state
<lb/> as you might expect but seemed much relieved that
<lb/> no trouble had arisen in Limerick or Cork as both places
<lb/> were reported as "very much disturbed" indeed.
<lb/> At 2.30 I restarted my journey homewards taking
<lb/> my usual route &#x2014; Bless you! soldiers hundreds
<lb/> of them on the march from Kingstown along Morehampton
        
    
         
        <pb n="926" facs="#L1916_345_img_926"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>road so I stayed to watch them pass. The people
<lb/> came out of the houses in numbers with all sorts
<lb/> of refreshments and the chaps <hi rend="underline">did</hi> enjoy the rest.
<lb/> Then I went on through Herbert Park where I stopped for
<lb/> a word or two with Mr Fannin - then on again to find
<lb/> Ballsbridge held by the military and a fairly smart fusillade
<lb/> in progress. 4 soldiers shot dead there during the morning!
<lb/> So I had to turn again and go out through Donnybrook
<lb/> and along by the Dodder and so home without any
<lb/> mishap at 4.30! much to Mrs Richard's surprise.</p> 
<p>I had a good wash, some tea and then strolled
<lb/> out to Mr Moore's place to ask about business arrange&#x2014;
<lb/>ments &#x2014; stayed there about 1 1/2 hours and then home.</p> 
<p>Steady firing going on all the time. This
<lb/> morning more military in from Kingstown &#x2014; full brigade
<lb/> all departments. Engineers, RAMC, Chaplains etc. etc.
<lb/> several batteries of artillery and a new gun
        
    
         
        <pb n="927" facs="#L1916_345_img_927"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>that goes off like a motorbike exhaust &#x2014; pop &#x2014; pop &#x2014; pop
<lb/> for 40 or 50 times together. The machine gunfire is
<lb/> like a glorified Electric bell without the gong.</p> 
<p>I got so far on Thursday night. It is now Satur
<lb/>day and I could write a book with what I've
<lb/> seen and heard since. The trouble is I don't know
<lb/> where to begin! Firing is going on constantly all
<lb/> the time &#x2014; up to tonight we have had none
<lb/> near us but tonight! Some S.F. chap had got
<lb/> into the second house in the avenue, up near
<lb/> the tramline you know, and fired at a soldier
<lb/> wounding him. Then the fun (?) began and
<lb/> the place was alive with the firing all round
<lb/> for quite 10 minutes &#x2014; then the end &#x2014; they got
<lb/> him dead! Really it is awful to think of!
<lb/> About half an hour or so after that there was
<lb/> some desultory firing and smack came a
<lb/> bullet against next door house. I skipped you
        
    
         
        <pb n="928" facs="#L1916_345_img_928"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>may be sure double quick time. Everyone
<lb/> has to be in by 7.30 or get hauled up.
<lb/> Damages so far are Boland's Bakery at Ringsend
<lb/> Shelled and a heap of ruins. Sackville St
<lb/> from the Bridge end. the D.B.C. and houses both
<lb/> sides of it <del>as far as Cleary's one one side</del> the
<lb/> whole front of that block in ruins and burnt
<lb/> to the ground. much other damage done here
<lb/> and there. In Grafton St the mob <hi rend="underline">looted</hi>
<lb/> Knowles (Fruit Shop) Leverette &amp; Fry's Woolworths
<lb/> Kapp &amp; Petersons, Noblettes and Maison Phillips.
<lb/> Switzers &amp; that end quite safe so far!</p>
<p>Today I rode over to Mr Wilsons to see
<lb/> whether any trains were running south
<lb/> and on the way passed a milk cart - 3 empty
        
    
         
        <pb n="929" facs="#L1916_345_img_929"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>tankards in it and horse lying dead between the
<lb/> shafts. shot two days ago and left there (I had walked
<lb/> along here on Wednesday - In S.C. Road our
<lb/> Church  at Dolphin's Barn had had one bomb thrown
<lb/> at it by the military  who thought they were being
<lb/> sniped from it and wouldn't wait for the door to
<lb/> be unlocked. I saw the damage - about forty
<lb/> holes in the ceiling &#x2014; curtains all holed and torn
<lb/> in streamers and a hole blown in the floor.
<lb/> One little child killed &#x2014; 9 1/2 years &#x2014; one of our children
<lb/> too now buried in the Manse Garden. I finally
<lb/> got up to Miss Wilson to find that he had
<lb/> not been home since Monday and he is on
<lb/> duty in Beggars Bush Barracks relieving the
<lb/> military. Perhaps the hottest spot hereabouts
<lb/> is just opposite Geo. Elliott's house &#x2014; some of you
        
    
         
        <pb n="930" facs="#L1916_345_img_930"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>may remember that the road branches there thus:
<!-- hand drawn map from Ballsbridge to Haddington Road showing Elliott's house at the junction between Pembroke Road and Lansdowne Road with the words "to Victor's [Comment: Wesley's brother who lived in Lansdowne Road) and into town" -->

<lb/>The house at the corner <!-- hand drawn symbol --> was held
<lb/> by the S.F. party with a machine gun
<lb/> and the soldiers were at Ballsbridge so you can
<lb/> imagine what a hot spot it was for 3 days until
<lb/> <hi rend="underline">14</hi> dead S.F. rebels  were accounted for and the house
<lb/> taken. The house farther on marked X at the
<lb/> corner of Haddington Road  is &#x2014; rather was &#x2014; a
<lb/> death trap and some of Victor's Volunteer Corps <!-- Victor was in A company of the 1st Battalion of the Irish Rugby Union Volunteer Corps -->
<lb/>  were shot from it on Monday &#x2014; one killed out
        
    
         
        <pb n="931" facs="#L1916_345_img_931"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>right and several wounded. You may remember
<lb/> the 3 men and the motor car in Monday's paper. <hi rend="underline">Well</hi>
<lb/> on the Saturday previously Sir Roger Casement was
<lb/> captured in Ireland  - taken to London and shot on
<lb/> the Sunday. This precipitated matters and Limerick
<lb/> and Cork were to have "gone out" also. Plans
<lb/> miscarried somewhat and Limerick &amp; Cork did
<lb/> not &#x2014; or at least not up to Wednesday to take the
<lb/> "official report" here as true. The other leaders here
<lb/> who are accounted for are Sheehy Skeffington
<lb/> taken and shot. O'Farrell J.C. (Ditto), Dickson (S.F.)
<lb/> ditto. Mrs Skeffington a prisoner and will be shot
<lb/> if not already. Countess Marckievicz &#x2014; a prisoner
<lb/> will be shot. Jas Connolly (Larkinite) wounded
<lb/> and a prisoner. Some rather alarming personal
<lb/> experiences were. Mrs D. Smith <add>was</add> showing some
<lb/> emergency guests their rooms on Tuesday night
        
    
         
        <pb n="932" facs="#L1916_345_img_932"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>when the window was fired at and the bullet
<lb/> came through the window frame sending splinters
<lb/> flying some through her hair. That was close
<lb/> enough for a start - another lady living close
<lb/> by was in her room getting emergency mattresses
<lb/> when an exactly similar experience befel her.</p>  
<p>The food question has become acute.
<lb/> If it weren't so awfully tragic it would be
<lb/> amusing to see the swells round about
<lb/> here carrying home bread and vegetables un&#x2014;
<lb/>covered or carried in suit cases hand
<lb/> bags, pillow cases cushion covers etc. etc.
<lb/> My bag and all belongings lies in Mr Boyd's.
<lb/> I can't get over to it! On the Tuesday night
        
    
         
        <pb n="933" facs="#L1916_345_img_933"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>as I was chatting with Mr Ross - he said he
<lb/> didn't know how he was to feed the people
<lb/> he had in - so I handed him out 3 lbs of my
<lb/> tea - keeping one lb for myself . So far <hi rend="underline">we</hi>
<lb/> have not had any shortage of food and have
<lb/> a few days of supply yet in hands but this is
<lb/> the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> time I did not bring up a box of
<lb/> things with me and look how badly we
<lb/> need it. You need not tell our mother but
<lb/> today I heard some soldiers lamenting their
<lb/> want of cigarettes and none were to be had
<lb/> in Ballsbridge so I cycled over to Donnybrook
<lb/> and invested <del>10</del>11/6 in cigs &amp; matches for free
<lb/> distribution as they wanted them. I must
<lb/> get absolution from St Peter for this later on
<lb/> but you would really pity the chaps and they are
        
    
         
        <pb n="934" facs="#L1916_345_img_934"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>all so cheery. There have been many casualties.
<lb/> I hear the "Daily Mail" put it at 14 killed
<lb/> and 20 odd wounded  &#x2014; but there are many more
<lb/> wounded. The hospitals are declining S.F. wounded
<lb/> I hear but I hardly credit it. Hospitals don't
<lb/> discriminate that way although it seems hard
<lb/> to have to take in those who caused all the
<lb/> sorrow and loss. but humanity is only humanity
<lb/> after all. Yesterday I spent cycling with
<lb/> a chum out to the mountains with field
<lb/> glasses to see if we could distinguish
<lb/> the damaged area. The City was very hazy
<lb/> and we could see very little that was of
<lb/> use to us. It was a glorious day and it
<lb/> was good to be away from the row
        
    
         
        <pb n="935" facs="#L1916_345_img_935"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>and excitement in the city &#x2014; </p>
<p>Sunday night &#x2014; I got so far yesterday and
<lb/> now for today and since. When I finished
<lb/> writing  last evg and was reading a bit there started
<lb/> a regular fusillade of shots up at the end of
<lb/> the Avenue on the tramline end - some chap
<lb/> was spotted somewhere and they blazed
<lb/> away I suppose about 200 shots in<del>as many</del> <add>about 2</add>
<lb/> minutes &#x2014; don't know whether they got him
<lb/> or not. Then last night &#x2014; or rather this morning &#x2014; there
<lb/> was tremendous shooting round about us and
<lb/> I heard this morning that the military
<lb/> were searching the gardens round about
<lb/> here. This afternoon they started "Shelling"
<lb/> a house in the avenue. I have marked it <!-- symbol --> on
<lb/> the map in black &#x2014; one shell fell short and burst
<lb/> on the road a splinter weighing 1/2 lb or so flying
<lb/> through a window of a house further down
        
    
         
        <pb n="936" facs="#L1916_345_img_936"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>and actually flying between father &amp; daughter
<lb/> without hurting either &#x2014; we can easily tell by
<lb/> the sound of the fire what sort it is and I
<lb/> have heard eight rounds (cannon) this
<lb/> afternoon. It seems a very haphazard
<lb/> thing to do, this shelling more or less in&#x2014;
<lb/>discriminately, but they know best I
<lb/> suppose and we are under martial law
<lb/> for a month. Numbers of prisoners are
<lb/> being taken and many are being tried to&#x2014;
<lb/>day God help the poor deluded fools
<lb/> led away by designing fire hands, they will
<lb/> pay a heavy price for their folly.</p> 
<p>Yesterday a lady in Haddington Road missed
<lb/> two blouses of her clothes line and on pursuing
<lb/> investigations further discovered a flying
        
    
         
        <pb n="937" facs="#L1916_345_img_937"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>S.F. in an outhouse. He pleaded for a suit of
<lb/> clothes and to be let away (he was in uniform).
<lb/> She asked advice from a gentleman lodger who
<lb/> refused to give her any. Then she went to the
<lb/> lady next door who told the lady next door who
<lb/> told the lady next door. The lodger thought the
<lb/> secret was well told so quietly slipped out
<lb/> and informed the military &#x2014; as the guard was
<lb/> passing the group of ladies one of them said
<lb/> "I don't know what you'll do with him" to which
<lb/> the soldier replied as he passed "Don't trouble
<lb/> yourself madam, I'll show you what should 
<lb/>be done with him" and eventually took
<lb/> him off.There are very strong rumours
<lb/> that in the City firing has ceased and that
<lb/> surrender has taken place, but as I write
<lb/> they are blazing away up the road and
        
    
         
        <pb n="938" facs="#L1916_345_img_938"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>What the night will bring forth no one can
<lb/> tell. There is no codding the military. You
<lb/> stop dead when you are told. A foot farther
<lb/> and you say "goodbye" but if you are quite
<lb/> amenable you can get along with them all &#x2014;
<lb/> right. They have a dangerous and difficult
<lb/> job. one that I am sure is repugnant
<lb/> to them to do and they are working for
<lb/> us all through. All this while I haven't
<lb/> said anything about you and how
<lb/> you must be feeling about me. Asbury
<lb/> held up and Haddie too to say nothing
<lb/> of the Lady Susan and Meg. I don't know
<lb/> a thing about you all but hope and have
<lb/> done a bit of praying that all continues
<lb/> to go well with you all. There were no

            <lb/>Church services in the City today so
<lb/> far as I know. I went down to Sandymount
<lb/> to see if there was any there and found that
<lb/> if the people came, there would be &#x2014; a very
<lb/> goodly number turned out and we had a
<lb/> quiet time. I never heard the Lord's Prayer
<lb/> followed so earnestly before. Mr McKeag
<lb/> was the preacher and his address was
<lb/> most apropos. I enclose a map on which
<lb/> I mark all the places that I have heard
<lb/> of so far in red ink &#x2014; the red line from
<lb/> Parkgate St to Serpentine Ave represents
<lb/> my walk on Wednesday &#x2014; I hear they
<lb/> are going to search the houses round
<lb/> here any time now so we are quite prepared
<lb/> for all sorts of inquisitions. I wish it was
<lb/> over and done with so that we might get
        
    
         
        <pb n="940" facs="#L1916_345_img_940"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>to normal again, if we ever do. The thing
<lb/> we are not to do is to photograph but when
<lb/> it is all over I suppose some of you will want
<lb/> to come up to see the results. And so ends
<lb/> Sunday's work up to 9<hi rend="superscript">pm</hi> though they are
<lb/> still firing away at odd moments. I shall
<lb/> need the enclosed things up as soon as
<lb/> you can get them through by passenger
<lb/> train and <del>phone</del> <add>advise</add> me <add>early post</add> when they are sent
<lb/> so that I may pick them up quickly &#x2014;
<lb/> make up in 2 packages for easy handling.
<lb/> pay carriage at your end to save delay
<lb/> here and address to 92 Grafton St please.
