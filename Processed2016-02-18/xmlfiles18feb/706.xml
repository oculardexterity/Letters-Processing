                            <p>This letter is from Irish Parliamentary Party leader and MP John Dillon (1851-1927) to Mabel Fitzgerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). Dillon had denounced the execution of the leaders in Westminster in a now famous speech on 11 May 1916 and in this letter he agrees that the treatments of prisoners in Richmond Barracks was bad but that after representations were made by him and others things had improved. He also mentions that in the future he may be able to do something to 'mitigate the harshness' of FitzGerald's sentence.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week. Dillon would succeed John Redmond (1856-1918) as leader of the Home Rule party in 1918.</p>

<salute>My dear Madam</salute></opener>
<p>I have received your
<lb/> letter of the 23 May.</p>
<p>Your description of the
<lb/> treatment endured by the
<lb/> prisoners in Richmond
<lb/> Barracks is very horrible.
<lb/>And your account is I
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="1734" facs="#L1916_706_img_1734"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>very much regret to say -
<lb/> confirmed by <hi rend="underline">many</hi> other
<lb/> accounts which have reached
<lb/> me.</p>
<p>Very strong representations
<lb/> have been made to the
<lb/> Government by myself and
<lb/> my colleagues in these
<lb/> matters &#x2014; And I understand that the
        
    
         
        <pb n="1735" facs="#L1916_706_img_1735"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>treatment at Richmond
<lb/> and other Dublin
<lb/> Barracks &#x2014; has within
<lb/> the last few days been
<lb/> very greatly improved.</p>
<p>Please find out
<lb/> how this matter now
<lb/> stands &amp; I shall
<lb/> attend immediately
<lb/> to any points which are
        
    
         
        <pb n="1736" facs="#L1916_706_img_1736"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>still matters of complaint.
<lb/> I shall keep in mind
<lb/> your husband's case &#x2014;
<lb/> And later on I may
<lb/> be able to do something
 to <del>null</del> mitigate the
<lb/> harshness of his sentence.</p>
