                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968). In this letter, Spender expresses admiration at how Lillian remains constantly fresh when writing letters, and makes several allusions to the pet names the couple have for each other ('Brown Wolf' and 'Pink Rabbit'). Spender updates Lillian on the progress of his report, and regrets his departure from the Ulster Division, as leave has been specifically approved for that Division. He asks Lillian to send on the letter to his family.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<p>I ought to be out, but it is raining, so
<lb/>I will begin a screed though I am not as fresh as
<lb/>the pr always appears to be in spite of her many
<lb/>hours at the desk. I like to see the way in
<lb/>which your committee think it necessary to
<lb/>get your approval &#x2014; even in regard to St Janes'
<lb/>Palace. &#x2014; I shall certainly write to <add>you</add> there when
<lb/>I am quite sure of the address! &#x2014; I am so
<lb/>glad that a Wolf's paw marks has the same
<lb/>effect as Cockles <add>(?)</add> pink pills according to the
<lb/>patient, but I'm afraid the bw riffs rather
<lb/>suspiciously as the compliment!</p>
<p> I had a great <unclear>wrestle</unclear> this morning and
<lb/>have completed the 34<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> page of my tome though

<!-- At top of page -->
<p>There is 
<lb/>a lot in 
<lb/>this letter
<lb/>which ought
<lb/>to have been
<lb/>reserved for
<lb/>a family
<lb/>letter. Can't
<lb/>you send it
<lb/>on ??
<lb/>certainly the
<lb/>last page</p>

            <lb/>very far from satisfied with it. It will need a
<lb/>lot of polish and I know a pr would make such
<lb/>an excellent chamois leather! I hear leave has
<lb/>been <sic>aproved</sic> specially for the Ulster and one or
<lb/>two other divisions &#x2014; boohoo why did I leave? &#x2014; </p>
<p>Today's afternoon wire caused such a lot
