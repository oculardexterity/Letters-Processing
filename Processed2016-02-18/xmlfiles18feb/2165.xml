                            <p>A letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) sending Christmas wishes to his mother,  Clara Mary, enclosing postcards which will interest her. He describes a visit to the Roman Catholic Cathedral where he enjoyed the organ music, including God Save the King. The officers will dine in a cafe at Christmas and have a sing song afterwards. He is looking forward to that.  He concludes that it is too much to believe the war will be over before next Christmas. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<salute>My dearest mother</salute>
<p>I have really not a scrap<lb/>
of news but hope this may reach you<lb/>
on Xmas day to takeyou all my best<lb/>
wishes. I think there is no doubt now<lb/>
that we shall be here for Xmas &amp; probably<lb/>
even for some weeks longer so we are <lb/>
arranging to spend a jolly a day as<lb/>
possible. The 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> officers are to dine together<lb/>
at the little café where I am billited  &amp;  there<lb/>
is to be a sing song afterwards. I expect<lb/>
we shall have quite a cheery evening.<lb/></p>
<p>The enclosed P.C.will be interesting to<lb/>
you especially the one marked 1 &amp; the two<lb/>
marked 2. The other 3 are of places we<lb/>
have been to. It will be a quick Xmas<lb/>
for you all this year &amp; I am afraid<lb/>
it is almost too much to believe that<lb/>
the War will be over before the next one<lb/>
