                            <p>A letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his mother, Clara. James refers to the letters and telegrams about his minor injury; is not happy that Payne is sending out his riding breeches as he wanted to try them on when he got home. He asks that apples are not sent in food parcels "as they don't arrive in very good condition". He suggests instead tinned things like gelatin of chicken, brawn, sardines, kippered herring and sausage as they "carry very well and make a welcome change from our rations which practically never vary".  He again criticises the reporting of his wound in the newspapers as it looks as if he orchestrated the publicity. He writes this is the first dry day which might help the trenches to dry out. There is a rumour that leave might be reinstated but he is not hopeful.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute> &#x2014; Since<lb/> I wrote last I have received<lb/> several letters from you &amp; <lb/>also one from May.  I also<lb/> received the wire asking how<lb/> I was, but I knew you would<lb/> have my letter almost at once <lb/>telling you all about it &amp;<lb/> in any case there is no use<lb/> wiring from here as it does<lb/> not go any quicker than a<lb/> letter.  Would you please<lb/> thank May for her letter<lb/> as I cant possibly find time<lb/> for a separate reply.<p>paragraph</p>
<p>paragraph</p>In your last letter you<lb/> say that Payne is sending out<lb/> my riding breeches,<lb/> but I never asked him<lb/> to do so.  What I wanted<pb/>

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute> &#x2014;<p> Since
<lb/>I wrote last I have received
<lb/> several letters from you &amp; 
<lb/>also one from May.  I also
<lb/> received the wire asking how
<lb/> I was, but I knew you would
<lb/> have my letter almost at once 
<lb/>telling you all about it &amp;
<lb/> in any case there is no use
<lb/> wiring from here as it does
<lb/> not go any quicker than a
<lb/> letter.  Would you please
<lb/> thank May for her letter
<lb/> as I cant possibly find time
<lb/> for a separate reply.</p>
<p>In your last letter you
<lb/> say that Payne is sending out
<lb/> my riding breeches,
<lb/> but I never asked him
<lb/> to do so.  What I wanted

<p><salute>My dearest Mother</salute> &#x2014; Since
<lb/>I wrote last I have received
<lb/> several letters from you &amp; 
<lb/>also one from May.  I also
<lb/> received the wire asking how
<lb/> I was, but I knew you would
<lb/> have my letter almost at once 
<lb/>telling you all about it &amp;
<lb/> in any case there is no use
<lb/> wiring from here as it does
<lb/> not go any quicker than a
<lb/> letter.  Would you please
<lb/> thank May for her letter
<lb/> as I cant possibly find time
<lb/> for a separate reply.</p>
<p>In your last letter you
<lb/> say that Payne is sending out
<lb/> my riding breeches,
<lb/> but I never asked him
<lb/> to do so.  What I wanted

            <lb/>him to do was to put a
<lb/> pair of riding breeches in
<lb/> hand &amp; have them ready
<lb/> to try on when I do get
<lb/> leave. There is no use
<lb/> his sending them out without
<lb/> trying on as they would be
<lb/> sure to be wrong.  I do
<lb/> hope they have not already
<lb/> been despatched. I think 
<lb/>Mother dear you might stop
<lb/> sending out apples as they
<lb/> dont arrive in very good
<lb/> condition &amp; instead send
<lb/> me an occasional parcel 
<lb/>of tinned things like gelantine
<lb/> of chicken, brown, sardines
<lb/> etc.  Kippered Herrings &amp; sausages
<lb/> (Palethorpes) also carry very well 
<lb/>&amp; they make a welcome change
<lb/> in our rations which practically
<lb/> never vary.  Would you please

            <lb/>tell Malcolmson when making
<lb/> up their usual parcel to
<lb/> include 1 tin of Coopers 
<lb/>marmelade instead of
<lb/> sweets &amp; to always send
<lb/> a gingerbread cake instead
<lb/> of varying the brand. </p>
<p>I see that the home papers
<lb/> made an awful fuss about
<lb/> my wound &amp; it sounds so 
<lb/>ridiculous to anyone who
<lb/> knows what actually happened. 
<lb/> There are any number of 
<lb/>similar escapes every day
<lb/> which are never spoken of 
<lb/>simply because they dont 
<lb/>necessitate attention from
<lb/> a D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> &amp;when the papers
<lb/> make so much out of
<lb/> so little it looks to others
<lb/> out here as if one had
<lb/> written &amp; made a great

            <lb/>story for self advertisement. 
<lb/> The cut is of course healed
<lb/> up long ago &amp; indeed I never
<lb/> felt the least inconvenience
<lb/> from it.  This was the
<lb/> first fine day we have had.
<lb/>  The sun was quite warm
<lb/> &amp; it made one feel quite
<lb/> bright &amp; cheery.  If it only
<lb/> continues for a little the
<lb/> trenches will soon dry up
<lb/> &amp; that will be such a relief
<lb/> for they are in a terrible state.
<lb/>  There is a rumour going round
<lb/> that leave is to start again
<lb/> soon but I am not counting
<lb/> on it.  Now I must close
<lb/> up with fondest love to
<lb/> all.</p>
