                            <p>A letter from Jeannie Johnson to George Hackney (1889-1977). Jennie expresses the hope that George is well and that he manages to hold on to his good luck. She writes that an imprisoned friend, 'Willie', has recently died of his wounds. Jeannie describes that she has recently returned home from a trip away, and gives some details of that trip, and of recent weather.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is from the papers of George Naphthali Hackney, a  Lance Corporal from Clifton, Belfast. Before his time in the army, he worked as a book-keeper for a florist. He was the youngest in a Presbyterian family of six, with three older sisters. In 2014, his collection of photographs taken in the trenches were made available to the public in an Ulster Museum exhibition, and his life and photography became the subject of a BBC documentary, 'The Man who Shot the Great War'. In 1916 he was injured and spent some time a Hospital in Calais, France, and in Wharncliffe War Hospital, Sheffield.</p>

4th September 1916
Dear Mr Hackney,
Many thanks for letter which i was glad to get.
I am so sorry that you have been ill. I do hope that you are feeling nearly yourself again. Indeed I dont wonder that you broke down after all was over. You must have come through a terrible time. I hope that your good luck will stick to you all

<salute>Dear Mr Hackney,</salute></opener>
 <p>Many thanks for letter which I was glad
<lb/> to get. I am so sorry that you have
<lb/> been ill. I do hope that you are feeling
<lb/> nearly yourself again. Indeed I dont
<lb/> wonder that you broke down after all
<lb/> was over. You must have come through
<lb/> a terrible time. I hope that your
<lb/> good luck will stick to you all.

            <lb/>through, &amp; that you will come safely home.
<lb/> You will have heard that poor
<lb/> Willlie died of wounds on July 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
<lb/> He was a prisoner poor boy.
<lb/> We had so hoped for good news
<lb/> of him.  It is just a short time
<lb/> since we heard.</p>
<p>I have got back home again 
<lb/>from the Country,  I had a very
<lb/> nice time.  I was quite sorry
<lb/>to come back to town life. 
<pb/>though it is nice to get settled down
<lb/> at home once again.  I seemed to be
<lb/>away such a lot this summer.
<lb/> I had very good weather all the 
<lb/>time I was away.  I did quite 
<lb/>a lot of walking &amp; also some
<lb/>cycling, but not a lot as it is
<lb/>nearly 7 or 8 years since I was
<lb/> on a bike, it did seem very strange 
<lb/> being on one again.  I much prefer
<lb/> walking. The  roads were in fine

            <lb/>order.  I hope to go to blackberrying
<lb/>some day very soon. The weather has
<lb/> been rather cold &amp; wet for the
<lb/> last week or so.   I see it is
<lb/> almost post time so I must close
<lb/> wishing you all good luck.</p> 
<p>With kindest regards &amp; good 
<lb/>wishes</p>
