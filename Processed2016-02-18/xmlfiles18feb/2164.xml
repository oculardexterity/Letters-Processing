                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute>&#x2014;Since I wrote
<lb/>you on Sat. last I have been having a
<lb/>very busy time of it.  The Brigade
<lb/>left for the Trenches on Sunday which
<lb/>meant no end of a fuss all round &amp;
<lb/>then the details left behind by the Baths
<lb/>at the various villages arrived in here
<lb/>&amp;I had to see to them being billeted
<lb/>&amp;c. As usual of course with these
<lb/>sudden moves rations &amp;fuel got
<lb/>wrong &amp;this took some straightening
<lb/>out but thank goodness things are
<lb/>now running fairly smoothly.
<lb/>  I have nearly 300 men left behind
<lb/> for special courses in Bombing &amp;
<lb/>machine gun work &amp;c but if
<lb/>present weather continues we shall
<lb/>not do much in that line. The
<lb/>Winter has come in with a vengeance.
<lb/> We wakened up on Sunday morning

to find the ground covered with about
<lb/>2 inches of snow.  It was bad luck
<lb/>for all the men starting on their long
<lb/>march to the trenches &amp;I felt very
<lb/>glad to be remaining in comfortable
<lb/>billets. The snow came on again
<lb/>during the night &amp;today it was almost
<lb/>6" deep &amp;now it is freezing hard
<lb/>&amp;bitterly cold.  I had to ride
<lb/>over lake this afternoon to see the
<lb/> Col. of the Artillery Brigade, about 4
<lb/>miles away, &amp;the cold was intense.
<lb/> I shall not be sorry to see the
<lb/>parcel with my warm underwear.
<lb/>  I dare say it might have come
<lb/>yest. or today, as I expect you

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute>&#x2014;Since I wrote
<lb/>you on Sat. last I have been having a
<lb/>very busy time of it. The Brigade
<lb/>left for the Trenches on Sunday which
<lb/>meant no end of a fuss all round &amp;
<lb/>then the details left behind by the Baths
<lb/>at the various villages arrived in here
<lb/>&amp;I had to see to them being billeted
<lb/>&amp;c. As usual of course with these
<lb/>sudden moves rations &amp;fuel got
<lb/>wrong &amp;this took some straightening
<lb/>out but thank goodness things are
<lb/>now running fairly smoothly.
<lb/>  I have nearly 300 men left behind
<lb/> for special courses in Bombing &amp;
<lb/>machine gun work &amp;c but if
<lb/>present weather continues we shall
<lb/>not do much in that line. The
<lb/>Winter has come in with a vengeance.
<lb/> We wakened up on Sunday morning

<lb/>to find the ground covered with about
<lb/>2 inches of snow.  It was bad luck
<lb/>for all the men starting on their long
<lb/>march to the trenches &amp;I felt very
<lb/>glad to be remaining in comfortable
<lb/>billets. The snow came on again
<lb/>during the night &amp;today it was almost
<lb/>6" deep &amp;now it is freezing hard
<lb/>&amp;bitterly cold.  I had to ride
<lb/>over lake this afternoon to see the
<lb/> Col. of the Artillery Brigade, about 4
<lb/>miles away, &amp;the cold was intense.
<lb/> I shall not be sorry to see the
<lb/>parcel with my warm underwear.
<lb/>  I dare say it might have come
<lb/>yest. or today, as I expect you
<lb/>sent it off some days ago, but
<lb/>with the Brigade moving, the mails
<lb/>were forwarded to the new H.Q<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>

<lb/>There are 10 other officers remaining

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute></opener>&#x2014;Since I wrote
<lb/>you on Sat. last I have been having a
<lb/>very busy time of it. The Brigade
<lb/>left for the Trenches on Sunday which
<lb/>meant no end of a fuss all round &amp;
<lb/>then the details left behind by the Baths
<lb/>at the various villages arrived in here
<lb/>&amp;I had to see to them being billeted
<lb/>&amp;c. As usual of course with these
<lb/>sudden moves rations &amp;fuel got
<lb/>wrong &amp;this took some straightening
<lb/>out but thank goodness things are
<lb/>now running fairly smoothly.
<lb/>  I have nearly 300 men left behind
<lb/> for special courses in Bombing &amp;
<lb/>machine gun work &amp;c but if
<lb/>present weather continues we shall
<lb/>not do much in that line. The
<lb/>Winter has come in with a vengeance.
<lb/> We wakened up on Sunday morning
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="5542" facs="#L1916_2164_img_5542"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>to find the ground covered with about
<lb/>2 inches of snow.  It was bad luck
<lb/>for all the men starting on their long
<lb/>march to the trenches &amp;I felt very
<lb/>glad to be remaining in comfortable
<lb/>billets. The snow came on again
<lb/>during the night &amp;today it was almost
<lb/>6" deep &amp;now it is freezing hard
<lb/>&amp;bitterly cold.  I had to ride
<lb/>over lake this afternoon to see the
<lb/> Col. of the Artillery Brigade, about 4
<lb/>miles away, &amp;the cold was intense.
<lb/> I shall not be sorry to see the
<lb/>parcel with my warm underwear.
<lb/>  I dare say it might have come
<lb/>yest. or today, as I expect you
<lb/>sent it off some days ago, but
<lb/>with the Brigade moving, the mails
<lb/>were forwarded to the new H.Q<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>

            <lb/>with the result that we dont get any
<lb/>letters or parcels till Thursday.  Am
<lb/> also looking anxiously for the tubes
<lb/>of toothpaste &amp;shaving soap.  My
<lb/>supply is absolutely finished &amp;one
<lb/>cant get any of these things about here.
<lb/>The big box of fruit came yest. &amp;
<lb/>the fruit was in splendid condition,
<lb/>which Berry will be pleased to know.
<lb/>There are 10 other officers remaining 
<lb/>with details so I have distributed
<lb/>most of the fruit &amp;it has been
<lb/>greatly enjoyed.  If however you
<lb/>can send some more later on
<lb/>it would be better to only make
<lb/>up a small parcel of say 1 doz
<lb/>apples or pears which would go
<lb/>by post as a large box takes so
<lb/>long to come &amp;has to be delivered
<lb/>by the A.S.C.</p>

            <p>I seem to be always worrying you
<lb/>dear Mother about sending things
<lb/>but really for anything outside our
<lb/>Govt. rations one has to depend on
<lb/>getting supplies from home. 
<lb/>Hope Kathleen &amp; Baby are both
<lb/>flourishing &#x2014; am looking forward
<lb/>to hearing all about them when
<lb/>mail arrives on Thurs. 
<p>If this weather continues we wont
<lb/>do much training with the guns but
<lb/> indeed as far as I can see I wont
<lb/> have much time to give any instruction
<lb/> with so many other matters to attend
<lb/> to &amp; I shall simply have to leave
<lb/> things to the <unclear>Sect.</unclear> officer.  With
<lb/> fondest love to all &amp; to my little 
<lb/>new niece.</p> <closer><salute>Your loving son</salute>

<add>Have just realised that Babys birthday 
<lb/>and K's birthday were almost the same.  
<lb/>My love &amp;best wishes to them for many
<lb/> happy returns.</add>
