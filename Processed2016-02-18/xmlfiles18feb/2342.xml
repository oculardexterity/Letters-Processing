                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, née Dean, (1880-1968). In this letter, Spender promises only 'a short scrawl', as he plans to drive out to two different corps to gather information on their history. He expresses concern at Lillian's heavy workload and recounts that he himself was up past midnight preparing a 'highly coloured' communiqué for the press - a task not helped by the fact that his various superiors all prefer different styles of writing. Spender also discusses financial matters, making particular reference to the rapidly falling price of rubber.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<salute>my pr</salute>
<p>After my long letter yesterday you will only get a 
<lb/>short paragraph today as I am preparing to go for a long motor
<lb/>down to visit 2 of the corps in the back areas to collect
<lb/>history. As I <del>only</del> got no pink pad marks yesterday, I contented myself
<lb/>very fairly by again following an old trail of the pr's 
<lb/>which I had kept back as reading to rather extra nice
<lb/>expeditions, and read it after (very) early service 7.30 AM rather
<lb/>a halo today, but I wondered if you turned up before I left church.</p>
<p>I wonder what you are deciding to do, not I hope
<lb/>getting worried by trying to force yourself to go on with work
<lb/>or by feeling too tired to make decisions for yourself tho'
<lb/>ready to do so continually at your own job.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did not finish my communiqué till
<lb/>past midnight though I had had it passed at 9pm &amp; sent
<lb/>out. Unluckily the C in C likes it at dinner and being
<lb/>toured by an article in Land &amp; Water which said "It is
<lb/>no thanks to the official communiqués that we have learnt
<lb/>the important bit of news that POZIERES mill has been 
<lb/>taken", insisted on a highly coloured account going out 
<lb/>at once which Butler Davidson &amp; myself proceeded to 
<lb/>decoct! If only I knew which particular client I had to 
<lb/>paint for it would make it so much easier, but while
<lb/>the C in C likes the colours  of a Turner, Kiggell with whom 
<lb/>I must agree- tho' called dismal by those who don't know him-
<lb/>likes the more subdued old dutch print style, Butler

<lb/>likes a nice little etching, and Charters through whom 
<lb/>I first pass my wares has a distinct liking for the glaring
<lb/>Christmas coloured print. However we all take it in good
<lb/>part and I on;y wish one's seniors could be spared the thought
<lb/>&amp; bother of the thing, tho' I shrewdly suspect it is a kind 
<lb/>of hobby more like a chain problem.</p>
<p>Let me know when you have quite made up your 
<lb/>mind about the maids. I don't intend to influence you
<lb/>against your judgement.</p> 
<p>By the way I enclose Maguire's business letter. 
<lb/>If you like either of them better than my choice of the 
<lb/>(NS Wales!) new loan, you can purchase <del>them</del> it instead <add>with your £300</add>. It
<lb/>means a little higher rate of interest at a little less
<lb/>security - the 2 go together of course -. It is jolly good
<lb/>for you to have this business! <add>You can consult the Pater</add> What I should like to
<lb/>do is to ensure that our income from safe investments and 
<lb/>pay and exclusions of <unclear>rubber</unclear> is sufficient to give us £800
<lb/>a year, so that we had the rubber to play with in getting
<lb/>our hutch and extras. At present with retired pay it is
<lb/>about £600 we can <hi rend="underline">count on</hi>, so that we read another £4000
<lb/>to be invested, of which thanks to the pr we shall have done 
<lb/>£1500 when our war certificates mature. At present rubber is
<lb/>giving us nearly £1500 a year but this cannot continue very long
<lb/>in spite of a pr's care. Rubber profits have indeed <del>half</del> halved 
<lb/>themselves already in the past 6 months!</p>

<salute>my pr</salute></opener>
<p>After my long letter yesterday you will only get a 
<lb/>short paragraph today as I am preparing to go for a long motor
<lb/>down to visit 2 of the corps in the back areas to collect
<lb/>history. As I <del>only</del> got no pink pad marks yesterday, I contented myself
<lb/>very fairly by again following an old trail of the pr's 
<lb/>which I had kept back as reading to rather extra nice
<lb/>expeditions, and read it after (very) early service 7.30 AM rather
<lb/>a halo today, but I wondered if you turned up before I left church.</p>
<p>I wonder what you are deciding to do, not I hope
<lb/>getting worried by trying to force yourself to go on with work
<lb/>or by feeling too tired to make decisions for yourself tho'
<lb/>ready to do so continually at your own job.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did not finish my communiqué till
<lb/>past midnight though I had had it passed at 9pm &amp; sent
<lb/>out. Unluckily the C in C likes it at dinner and being
<lb/>toured by an article in Land &amp; Water which said "It is
<lb/>no thanks to the official communiqués that we have learnt
<lb/>the important bit of news that POZIERES mill has been 
<lb/>taken", insisted on a highly coloured account going out 
<lb/>at once which Butler Davidson &amp; myself proceeded to 
<lb/>decoct! If only I knew which particular client I had to 
<lb/>paint for it would make it so much easier, but while
<lb/>the C in C likes the colours  of a Turner, Kiggell with whom 
<lb/>I must agree- tho' called dismal by those who don't know him-
<lb/>likes the more subdued old dutch print style, Butler
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="6483" facs="#L1916_2342_img_6483"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>likes a nice little etching, and Charters through whom 
<lb/>I first pass my wares has a distinct liking for the glaring
<lb/>Christmas coloured print. However we all take it in good
<lb/>part and I on;y wish one's seniors could be spared the thought
<lb/>&amp; bother of the thing, tho' I shrewdly suspect it is a kind 
<lb/>of hobby more like a chain problem.</p>
<p>Let me know when you have quite made up your 
<lb/>mind about the maids. I don't intend to influence you
<lb/>against your judgement.</p> 
<p>By the way I enclose Maguire's business letter. 
<lb/>If you like either of them better than my choice of the 
<lb/>(NS Wales!) new loan, you can purchase <del>them</del> it instead <add>with your £300</add>. It
<lb/>means a little higher rate of interest at a little less
<lb/>security - the 2 go together of course -. It is jolly good
<lb/>for you to have this business! <add>You can consult the Pater</add> What I should like to
<lb/>do is to ensure that our income from safe investments and 
<lb/>pay and exclusions of <unclear>rubber</unclear> is sufficient to give us £800
<lb/>a year, so that we had the rubber to play with in getting
<lb/>our hutch and extras. At present with retired pay it is
<lb/>about £600 we can <hi rend="underline">count on</hi>, so that we read another £4000
<lb/>to be invested, of which thanks to the pr we shall have done 
<lb/>£1500 when our war certificates mature. At present rubber is
<lb/>giving us nearly £1500 a year but this cannot continue very long
<lb/>in spite of a pr's care. Rubber profits have indeed <del>half</del> halved 
<lb/>themselves already in the past 6 months!</p>
