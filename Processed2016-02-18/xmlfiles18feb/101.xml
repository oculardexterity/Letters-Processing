                            <p>A letter from a prisoner of war, Corporal W. Bowes, Connaught Rangers, to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Corporal Bowes was incarcerated in a German camp in Gustrow at the time. In the letter he thanks Lady Clonbrock for two parcels of food and cigarettes that he had received. He mentions that there is sometimes a delay in receiving the parcels as the men are regularly moved from camp to camp. He also briefly refers to the good weather and the passing the day in the camp.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>
