Reverend Kelso writes that he was badly wounded, but was in good spirits and was hopeful of making a recovery to return home.  Kelso writes that he saw Moore daily and everything possible was being done for him. He also corrects and  error from a previous letter: Charlie Walt, which he wrote was dead, was in fact, alive and well and not wounded.</p>

Dear Mrs Jackson
Your son Moore Jackson is in no 3 Canadian hospital here and he asked me to notify you of this fact. I am sorry to say that he has been pretty badly wounded and has been dangerously I'll ever since his coming here. I see him almost every day and so far as I can judge he is getting a little e circumstancesbetter and today he told me that he was in hopes of making a retry good recovery. He is in fairly good spirits - considering &amp; I am hopeful that his naturally cheery disposition and good healthy constitution may - under the Good Providence of God - spare Him to return to you and his home

<salute>Dear Mrs Jackson</salute></opener> 
<p>Your Son, Moore Jackson, 
<lb/>is in no 3 Canadian Hospital here &amp; He asked 
<lb/>me to notify you of this fact. I am sorry to say 
<lb/>that he is pretty badly wounded &amp; has been 
<lb/>dangerously ill ever since his coming here 
<lb/> I see him almost every day &amp; so far as I can 
<lb/>judge he is getting a little better &amp; to-day he 
<lb/>told me that he was in hopes of making a pretty 
<lb/>good recovery. He is in fairly good spirits, 
<lb/>considering the circumstances &amp; I am hopeful that 
<lb/>his naturally cheery disposition &amp; good healthy 
<lb/>constitution may - under the good Providence of God - 
<lb/>spare him return to you &amp; his home. You 
<lb/> may rest assured that everything will be done to 
<lb/>assure this &amp; both Doctors &amp; Nurses are most 
<lb/>attentive to him as he is such a nice boy &amp; a 
<lb/>general favourite with them all.</p>
<p>He asked me to tell you that he had made a mistake 
<lb/>in the last letter to you in saying that Charlie 
<lb/>Walt had been killed. This is not so as your boy 
<lb/> saw him since he wrote you &amp; so far as he knows at
<lb/>present he is alive &amp; well.</p>
<p>Hoping to have better news for you soon </p>
<closer><salute>Sincerely Yours</salute>.
