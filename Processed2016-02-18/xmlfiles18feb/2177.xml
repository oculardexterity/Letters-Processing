                            <p>Letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his mother, Clara Mary. In this letter to his mother, Davison reflects on the news of his family's Christmas. He writes that the 36th Division is being  relocated back to their previous location.  He is despondent about the continuous moves (c 10 times within three months of their arriving in France). He comments that the 36th Division is sent in 'to clean up a district', hence their being referred to as 'Carsons Travelling Menagerie'.  He closes the letter in anticipation of receiving khaki mufflers and mittens so they can be distributed to some of the men.  He wishes his grandmother and the rest of the family a happy new year.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

My dearest Mother - It will soon be<lb/>1916 but I am very tired this evening &amp;<lb/> don't intend to sit up &amp; see the new<lb/> year in. Your letter of 28th arrived<lb/> today and it was a quiet xmas for you<lb/>all this year but I am glad .. were able to be with you. We<lb/>all thought we would be remaining<lb/> here for some little tie to come but<lb/>orders have just come that we are to<lb/>move back to our previous area next<lb/>week - probably Thurs. or Friday. Isn't<lb/> it sickening! We had just got things nicily nicely fixed up here &amp; now have to return<lb/>to uncomfortable village quarters. I<lb/> think this must be about our 10th move since we arrived in France 3 months<lb/>ago. When any district requires to be cleaned up the 36th Div. always seems<lb/><pb/>

<salute>My dearest Mother</salute></opener> <p>&#x2014; It will soon be
<lb/>1916 but I am very tired this evening &amp;
<lb/> don't intend to sit up &amp; see the New
<lb/> Year in. </p><p>Your letter of 28<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> arrived
<lb/> today &#x2014; it was a quiet Xmas for you
<lb/>all this year but I am glad Mr &amp; Mrs
<lb/> Vard were able to be with you.</p><p> We
<lb/>all thought we would be remaining
<lb/> here for some little time to come but
<lb/>orders have just come that we are to
<lb/>move back to our previous area next
<lb/>week &#x2014; probably Thurs. or Friday. Isn't
<lb/> it sickening! We had just got things
<lb/> nicely fixed up here &amp; now have to return
<lb/> to uncomfortable village quarters. I 
<lb/> think this must be about our 10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> move 
<lb/>since we arrived in France 3 months
<lb/>ago.</p><p> When any district requires to be
<lb/> cleaned up the 36<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="superscript">th</hi></hi> Div. always seems

            <lb/>to be selected to do the dirty work. No
<lb/> wonder we are known as Carsons travelling
<lb/>menagerie.</p><p> We would all much prefer
<lb/>to be going back to the trenches for we are just
<lb/>about fed up with this treking about for no
<lb/>object &amp; the continual training.</p>
<p>As regards khaki mufflers &amp; mittens, if you
<lb/>have some to spare I dare say I could dispose
<lb/>of a few amongst the  Bde. H.Q<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. men but as
<lb/> a general rule most of them are already 
<lb/>supplied in this direction.</p><p> With love &amp; 
<lb/>every good wish for the coming year to you<lb/>dear mother &amp; all at home.</p>
