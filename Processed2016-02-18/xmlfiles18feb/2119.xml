                            <p>A letter from Dorothy Duffin (b. 1881) to her Aunt. Dorothy's main news is that her sister Emma (1883–1979) has returned from Alexandria, Egypt, where she served as a VAD, and is currently in London. Dorothy is hoping that she, Olive and Celia will get to see her. She remarks on seeing women employed by the railway and comments that a job as a bus conductor would be 'infinitely more attractive than ordinary clerical work'. She describes a trip to St. John's Gate with her sister, Celia, and they discovered that there is little chance of Celia getting a posting abroad (France), of of Dorothy herself being called up.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a rich correspondence between various members of the Duffin family, a large prosperous family living in Strandtown, Belfast. Several family members served in the war, including Major Terence Duffin, who served as a staff officer with 107 Brigade, and later with Royal Irish Rifles; Major Charles G Duffin MC, Royal Field Artillery; and their sisters Emma, Celia and Dorothy who served as Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADS) in Egypt and France, and with the YMCA.</p>

<p>Emma has just<lb/>

Strand Palace Hotel! I am going<lb/>
to meet her <sic>to-morrow</sic> morning &amp; she<lb/>
has wired to  Olive so I expect she<lb/>

get off. Such a gathering! I could<lb/>
not hear a word she said over the<lb/>
telephone <hi rend="underline">except</hi> the address! What<lb/>
a lot she will have to tell!</p>
<p>I have been doing all I can to find<lb/>
a job &amp; have been to several Bureaux<lb/>
Associations etc. Miss <unclear>Sharok</unclear> started<lb/> 
me with two letters. I was passed<lb/>
 on to several people who took notes<lb/>
about me, but I can't tell if any<lb/>
thing may turn up. I am not going<lb/>
to take ordinary office work on small<lb/>
pay. They tell me private residential work<lb/>
 is now almost nil. Since the<lb/>
War. I sent in a form to the War

<p>Emma has just<lb/>
telephoned to say she is at the<lb/>
Strand Palace Hotel! I am going<lb/>
to meet her <sic>to-morrow</sic> morning &amp; she<lb/>
has wired to  Olive so I expect she<lb/>
will be there too. I hope Celia can<lb/>
get off. Such a gathering! I could<lb/>
not hear a word she said over the<lb/>
telephone <hi rend="underline">except</hi> the address! What<lb/>
a lot she will have to tell!</p>
<p>I have been doing all I can to find<lb/>
a job &amp; have been to several Bureaux<lb/>
Associations etc. Miss <unclear>Sharok</unclear> started<lb/> 
me with two letters. I was passed<lb/>
 on to several people who took notes<lb/>
about me, but I can't tell if any<lb/>
thing may turn up. I am not going<lb/>
to take ordinary office work on small<lb/>
pay. They tell me private residential work<lb/>
 is now almost nil. Since the<lb/>
War. I sent in a form to the War

            Office. It is disappointing about the<lb/> 
Admiralty. Uncle Edmund says it is <lb/>
no use going there without a definite <lb/>
letter of introduction to a definite <lb/>
man. I wrote to Mrs Arnold-Forster <lb/>
about a week ago asking for her <lb/>
advice &amp; if she <add>would</add> give an introduction <lb/>
but have heard nothing from her <lb/>
so I am stuck.</p> 
<p>Aunt Fanny &amp; Uncle Edmund are as <lb/>
kind as possible &amp; I expect to stay <lb/>
here <sic>till</sic> April 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> &amp; then go to <lb/>
the <unclear>Donnets</unclear> at Eastbourne. After <lb/>
that Olive tells me she will be <lb/>
"on the loose" for a fortnight as<lb/> 
Miss Roberts is closing her house <lb/>
to give the household a rest, and <lb/>
will not require her. I hope we can <lb/>
arrange to join together somehow for <lb/>
that fortnight.</p>
<p>Baby <unclear>Lee</unclear> is a great joy. I don't <lb/>
know what they would do without <lb/>
her. She is a plain but attractive

            little soul. <unclear>Emmie Epson</unclear> has decided <lb/>
to remain on in India for the present.</p>
<p>My heart aches for Charlie &amp; Marjorie <lb/>
but I am glad they are together, if <lb/>
only for a short time. It is vexing <lb/>
that Charlie's training is not what was <lb/>
expected. If Marjorie wants me I shall <lb/>
go to her but perhaps she will think <lb/>
of being with her <unclear>poor Aunts</unclear> for <lb/>
a little bit.</p>
<p>Uncle Edmund has gone off to golf &amp; <lb/>
Aunt Fanny &amp; I are going to walk <lb/>
over the Downs to <unclear>Tadworth</unclear> and <lb/>
see Harry and Janet. I am anxious <lb/>
to see their children. It will be <lb/>
a cold, stormy, long walk but Aunt <lb/>
Fanny says she is able for it.</p>
<p>I hope Aunt Charlotte's throat and <lb/>
ear are better &amp; that Craig can really <lb/>
make her well. Have you good <lb/>
news of <unclear>Effie</unclear>? I trust the change <lb/>
is a success.</p>
<p>I have met Celia twice, &amp; she stayed
        
    
         
        <pb n="5372" facs="#L1916_2119_img_5372"/>
        
        
           
            a night here. She looks well and is <lb/>
cheerful.</p> 
<p>It is interesting seeing women in <lb/>
London employed at all the railway <lb/>
stations, on lifts, omnibuses etc. <lb/>
I think being an omnibus conductor <lb/>
would be infinitely more attractive <lb/>
than ordinary clerical work.</p>
<p>Celia &amp; I made our way over to St <lb/>
John's Gate &amp; interviewed Lady <unclear>Olivia</unclear>,<lb/> 
who was covered with orders and <lb/>
ribbons. She told Celia there was not <lb/>
much chance of her getting abroad.<lb/> 
I doubt if I shall be called up <lb/>
at all now as the demand for <lb/>
V.A.D. nurses is evidently not so great.<lb/>
St John's Gate is a quaint old <lb/>
place. The walls lined with portraits <lb/>
of the knights, suits of armour etc.<lb/> 
We got lost several times in the <lb/>
back streets of <unclear>Clerkenwell</unclear> but found <lb/>
the place eventually.</p>
<p>I was all over London the other day
        
    
         
        <pb n="5373" facs="#L1916_2119_img_5373"/>
        
        
           
            from the heart of the City to South <lb/>
Kensington. Finding the way was quite <lb/>
amusing, but interviewing the heads <lb/>
of offices &amp; Bureaus became wearisome <lb/>
&amp; I got a glimpse of the deadly boredom <lb/>
of London offices!</p>
<p>Best love to all the Aunties &#x2014; I <lb/>
was so glad to get your letter. <lb/>
Days are very long here, but I try <lb/>
to be cheery for Aunt Fanny, and <lb/>
if we all 4 meet in London <sic>to-morrow</sic> <lb/>
it will be splendid.</p>
