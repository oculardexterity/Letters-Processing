                            <p>Letter from the father of Patrick Langford Beazley to his son, Piaras (1881-1965), after his arrest and imprisonment after the Rising. It details the strain his parents were under before they heard that Piaras was unhurt. The letter gives accounts of the Irish neighbours in the Cheshire area calling to the family home for support. It includes details on looking after Piaras's personal belongings as well as encouraging him to keep his spirits up.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Piaras Béaslaí (born Percy Frederick Beazley) was an English born writer, revolutionary, politician, language revivalist, journalist and a member of the IRB. In February of 1916 he published the Fàinne, a publication to organise Gaelic speakers. He soon abandoned it and became involved in politics and would later fight in the Easter Rising. He wrote twenty plays between 1913 and 1939. Patrick Langford Beazley was  born near Killarney, Co. Kerry, son of a tenant who had been evicted from the Lansdowne estate. The Beazleys were an old family in Kerry, of English origin. He was the editor of the Catholic Times from 1884 until his death in the early 1920s.</p>

Glengariff,

25th May, 1916.
My dearest Pierce,
It was such a delight to mother and myself to get your long letter. Langford, having come back after his holiday, had written once and we were expecting that in his next letter he might be able to tell us where you were. Mother and I were just discussing the matter at dinner on Monday last, May 22, and impatient at not hearing from Langford when Nellie brought in from the

postman a letter in handwriting that I did not know. I opened it carelessly and saw a printed form. I began to wonder whether I had received a summons for something or other when I turned it and lo, there were your own handwriting and signature. As you can imagine the strain on me for some time previously was pretty severe, but this was the first time I gave way to the weakness of tears. It was like having you with us again for a while. Of course Mother and I read and re-read the letter and indeed were charmed with the spirit of it. It is just the kind of letter we hoped for - bright, brave, cheerful and showing a disposition to accept ?exerting? conditions contentedly. I cannot say how glad I was to find not only that you were well, thank God, but that you were accepting  your position philosophically and resolved to comply with the rules. Wherever one is one can be happy by striving to do God's Will.
You will be anxious to know how Mother is and how she bears up. Thank God she is quite well and has bourne up wonderfully. Indeed everybody who has come to see her has been gratified to find how well

she has kept up her spirits. Of course she and I have thought much about you, have been thinking of you every day and every hour ; but your assurances that you are in the best of health, that the place in which are is very healthy, being close to the sea, that the prison is admirably managed, that everybody seems to be fairly treated, that the food is good and sufficient and the work not too hard, and that you are allowed books to read in spare moments, have given us great comfort.

Another evening we had a visit from the Whiteheads - Aggie and Teresa. Aggie is still exceedingly lively and their coming was a decided pleasure to Mother, especially as they came on a Wednesday evening when she was alone. I returned from the office before they left.

The Longs have all had a rather bad attack of influenza, but they are now better. We have been hearing of course from Carey and I have a very kind note from Canon Walsh of Liscard. Nora Murphy and Mr. Lamble dropped in one evening. Nora was to return to the college at Hull next day. She is not keeping up a correspondence with the old man now.
Langford had quite a singular experience in returning from his holiday. On Bank Holiday he went as far as Holyhead but found he could not go farther and returned on Tuesday. He remained ?home? till Friday and then went as far as Kingstown, but returned again and remained for another week. Like the dove of the Ark, when he went a third time he did not return.

and his wife came last Sunday. We have had a very warm-hearted letter from Father James and Aunt Ellie has sent a couple of long letters during the past fortnight. The Longs have all had a rather bad attack of influenza, but they are now better. We have been hearing of course from Carey and I have a very kind note from Canon Walsh of Liscard. Nora Murphy and Mr. Lamble dropped in one evening. Nora was to return to the college at Hull next day. She is not keeping up a correspondence with the old man now.
Langford had quite a singular experience in returning from his holiday. On Bank Holiday he went as far as Holyhead but found he could not go farther and returned on Tuesday. He remained ?home? till Friday and then went as far as Kingstown, but returned again and remained for another week. Like the dove of the Ark, when he went a third time he did not return. He wrote over and said he was hard worked. We are expecting a second letter from him. I have written to your landlady, asking her to send the bill and I have asked Langford to call on her for your clothes, etc. I am writing to Mr. J.J.O'Kelly, of M.H. Gill and Son, telling him, as you have requested, that you have given him power to do

Many friends of yours have been enquiring about your health and of course I have been happy to tell them you are very well and to give them your kind regards. I have asked Langford to do likewise..
And now that I am drawing to a close, I would say : keep your spirits up and be of good cheer. God is good. We are well and shall try to keep well till you come back, please God, and I am sure you will be as careful of your health as you can. You will, no doubt, be able to let me know through the Governor when I can see you and I shall do so at any cost or trouble.
The garden is nice now, but we shall, please God, have it nicer when you come. Langton has talked & thought much of you.  May God give you every pleasure. With the fondest love of our hearts from Mother him and myself

<p>It was such a delight
<lb/> to mother and myself to
<lb/> get your long letter. Lang&#x2014;
<lb/> ford, having gone back after
<lb/> his holiday, had written
<lb/> once and we were ex&#x2014;
<lb/> pecting that in his next
<lb/> letter he might be able to
<lb/> tell us where you were. Mo&#x2014;
<lb/> ther and I were just dis&#x2014;
<lb/> cussing the matter at
<lb/> dinner on Monday last, May
<lb/> 22, and impatient at not
<lb/> hearing from Langford when
<lb/> Nellie brought in from the
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="587" facs="#L1916_234_img_587"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>postman a letter in hand
<lb/> writing that I did not know.
<lb/> I opened it carelessly and
<lb/> saw a printed form. I 
<lb/> began to wonder whether I
<lb/> had received a summons for
<lb/> something or other when I
<lb/> turned it and lo, there were
<lb/> your own handwriting and
<lb/> signature. As you can
<lb/> imagine the strain on me
<lb/> for some time previously was
<lb/> pretty severe, but this was
<lb/> the first time I gave way
<lb/> to the weakness of tears. It
<lb/> was like having you with
<lb/> us again for a while. Of
<lb/> course Mother and I read
<lb/> and re-read the letter and in
<lb/> deed were charmed with the
<pb/>
<lb/>  spirit of it. It is just the
<lb/> kind of letter we hoped for &#x2014;
<lb/> bright, brave, cheerful and
<lb/> showing a disposition to
<lb/> accept <unclear>exerting</unclear> conditions con-
<lb/> tentedly. I cannot say how
<lb/> glad I was to find not only
<lb/> that you were well, thank
<lb/> God, but that you were accep
<lb/> ting your position philo&#x2014;
<lb/> sophically and resolved to
<lb/> comply with the rules. Wherev&#x2014;
<lb/> er one is one can be happy by
<lb/> striving to do God's Will!</p>
<p>You will be anxious to
<lb/> know how Mother is and
<lb/> how she bears up. Thank
<lb/> God she is quite well and
<lb/> has borne up wonderfully.
<lb/> Indeed everybody who has
<lb/> come to see her has been
<lb/> gratified to find how well
        
    
         
        <pb n="588" facs="#L1916_234_img_588"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>she has kept up her spirits.
<lb/> Of course she and I have
<lb/> thought much about you,
<lb/> have been thinking of you
<lb/> every day and every hour ; but
<lb/> your assurances that you are
<lb/> in the best of health, that the
<lb/> place in which are is very
<lb/> healthy, being close to the sea,
<lb/> that the prison is admirably
<lb/> managed, that everybody
<lb/> seems to be fairly treated,
<lb/> that the food is good and
<lb/> sufficient and the work not
<lb/> too hard, and that you are
<lb/> allowed books to read in
<lb/> spare moments, have given
<lb/> us great comfort. We have
<lb/> had quite a number of visitors
<lb/> during the past few weeks.
<lb/> Mrs. O'Callaghan and <unclear>Mat</unclear>
<lb/> came and spent an evening
<lb/> with us. She is as vivacious

<lb/>as ever and the years do not
<lb/> seem to tell on her. They said
<lb/> that Charley was doing very
<lb/> well in Madras. Frank had
<lb/> been at home during the Easter
<lb/> holidays and had just re&#x2014;
<lb/> turned. Another evening we
<lb/> had a visit from the White&#x2014;
<lb/> heads - Aggie and Teresa. Aggie 
<lb/> is still exceedingly lively and
<lb/> their coming was a decided
<lb/> pleasure to Mother, espe&#x2014;
<lb/> cially as they came on a
<lb/> Wednesday evening when she
<lb/> was alone. I returned from
<lb/> the office before they left.
<lb/> Miss Golden has also paid
<lb/> us two visits and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh

            <lb/> and his wife came last Sun&#x2014;
<lb/> day. We have had a very
<lb/> warm-hearted letter from
<lb/> Father James and Aunt
<lb/> Ellie has sent a couple of
<lb/> long letters during the
<lb/> past fortnight. The Longs
<lb/> have all had a rather bad
<lb/> attack of influenza, but they
<lb/> are now better. We have
<lb/> been hearing of course from
<lb/> Carey and I have a very kind
<lb/> note from Canon Walsh of
<lb/> Liscard. Nora Murphy and
<lb/> Mr. Lamble dropped in one
<lb/> evening. Nora was to return
<lb/> to the college at Hull next
<lb/> day. She is not keeping up
<lb/>  correspondence with the old 
<lb/> man now.</p>
<p> Langford had quite a singular
<lb/> experience in returning
<pb/>
<lb/> from his holiday. On Bank Holi&#x2014;
<lb/> day he went as far as Holy&#x2014;
<lb/> head but found he could not
<lb/> go farther and returned on
<lb/> Tuesday. He remained here till
<lb/> Friday and then went as far
<lb/> as Kingstown, but returned
<lb/> again and remained for an&#x2014;
<lb/>other week. Like the dove
<lb/> of the Ark, when he went
<lb/> a third time he did not
<lb/> return. He wrote once and
<lb/> said he was hard worked. We
<lb/> are expecting a second letter
<lb/> from him. I have written to
<lb/> your landlady, asking her
<lb/> to send the bill and I have
<lb/> asked Langford to call on her
<lb/> for your clothes, etc. I am writing
<lb/> to Mr. J.J.O'Kelly, of M.H.
<lb/> Gill and Son, telling him, as
<lb/> you have requested, that you
<lb/> have given him power to do
        
    
         
        <pb n="591" facs="#L1916_234_img_591"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>as he likes with the manu&#x2014;
<lb/> scripts you left with him.</p>
<p>Many friends of yours have
<lb/> been enquiring about your
<lb/> health and of course I have
<lb/> been happy to tell them you
<lb/> are very well and to give them
<lb/> your kind regards. I have asked
<lb/> Langford to do likewise.</p>
<p>And now that I am draw&#x2014;
<lb/>ing to a close, I would say : Keep
<lb/> your spirits up and be of good
<lb/> cheer. God is good. We are well
<lb/> and shall try to keep well
<lb/> till you come back, please God,
<lb/> and I am sure you will be as
<lb/> careful of your health as you
<lb/> can. You will, no doubt, be able
<lb/> to let me know through the Gov&#x2014;
<lb/> ernor when I can see you and I
<lb/> shall do so at any cost or trouble.
<lb/>The garden is nice now, but we
<lb/> shall, please God, have it nicer when
<lb/> you come. Langford has talked &amp; thought
<lb/> much of you.  May God give you every
<lb/> pleasure. With the fondest love of our
<lb/> hearts from Mother him and myself </p>
