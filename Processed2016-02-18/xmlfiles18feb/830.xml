                            <p>A letter is from Colonel J.H.G. Stantin of the Irish Command, British army, to Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). The letter informs Mrs. FitzGerald of the sentence passed on her husband at court-martial, and advises her of his transfer to Mountjoy Prison.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>
