                            <p>This letter is from Edward H. Andrews, honorary secretary of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, to Arthur John Bigge (1849-1931), 1st Baron Stamfordham, private secretary to King George V. The letter enclosed a resolution passed by the Chamber of Commerce at a meeting that day. The resolution states that the chamber wish to express the 'loyalty of the Commercial community' to the king, record their 'abhorrence' at the Rising. They also blame the Irish administration for the Rising due to their 'unpardonable laxity' and request that funds be supplied to compensate 'unoffending citizens' whose property was destroyed.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Arthur John Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham, was the private secretary to King George V. Bigge has served in the same position for Queen Victoria during the final years of her reign. Bigge exercised considerable influence over King George V and advised the change of family name from Saxe-Colburg-Gotha to Windsor.</p>
