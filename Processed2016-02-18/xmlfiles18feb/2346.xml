                            <p>Letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, née Dean, (1880-1968). In this letter, Spender lists the birthdays of himself (his pet-name is 'Wolf') and his family, but states that he cannot yet remember the dates of 'extraneous events' such as wedding anniversaries and Lillian's birthday. Spender writes that he has seen his name on a list, and suspects that it means he will soon be moved to a Division as he has long wanted, although he thinks a  pity that he will lose the opportunity to finish his dispatch. He discusses the difficulty of translating the experience of war into the limited, inexpressive vocabulary he may use with the Press, and complains of the laziness of his typing clerk. He briefly mentions golf, relations among the officers, and the difficulty the army is having in recruiting outside Belfast due to Sinn Féin activity.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender (1876 - 1960) was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War.</p>

<p>Douglas who has

<lb/>in the mess is to do
<lb/>4 days full duty in

<lb/>he was not quite keen
<lb/>about it but think it
<lb/>was only a little hesitation.
<lb/>Certainly 4 days full
<lb/>work will be a good

<lb/>him occupied which it
<lb/>is his nature to be.</p>

<lb/>not like the bow's classical spelling as much as
<lb/>a pr so am very careful in my selection of
<lb/>words, but how I hate the inexpressive
<lb/>Artillery activity when I know what it
<lb/>really means from actual experience. </p>
<p>My typing clerk has been rather lazy
<lb/>&amp; I am being held up in consequence, very
<lb/>annoying as I feel the days gaining on me
<lb/>but I mean to have a real set to again
<lb/>this afternoon so as to finish July by the
<lb/>end of this! week. It would make it so 
<lb/>much easier to have a certain lady typist!</p>
<p>I am amused at Greatmen's little foibles: &#x2014;

            <lb/>Butler's I have described, Sir DH's is his golf
<lb/>the one <del>game</del> <add>thing</add> at which he is perhaps rather behind
<lb/>his contemporaries tho my no means a bad
<lb/>player. They say that he would rather get
<lb/>a reduction of 4 in his handicap than an
<lb/>O M Garter or whatever particular decoration
<lb/>he still lacks.</p>
<p>Kiggell's simplicity is very striking he will
<lb/>continually hold a young officer's horse whilst he
<lb/>speaks to the Chief without thinking it in the
<lb/>least <foreign>infra dig</foreign></p>. 
<p>I hear from Douglas that
<lb/>security in Belfast is improving but that outside
<lb/>the Sinn Feiners <unclear>discountenance</unclear> any security
<lb/>meetings!</p>

            <p>I could not help noticing my name on a
<lb/>list with 2 others &#x2014; presumably sent forward
<lb/>as suggestions for appointment to a Division.
<lb/>It is rather like references of a butler. In
<lb/>some ways I should have liked to have finished
<lb/>the dispatch first as I have now got into it,
<lb/>but I am making very heavy weather of it
<lb/>and perhaps it will be as well to introduce
<lb/>fresh blood. Gen' B has been away &amp; I
<lb/>find the CGS a much more indulgent reader
<lb/>of my daily efforts &amp; get them passed in
<lb/>a few minutes usually without comments,
<lb/>whilst with B it has become a regular 
<lb/>jigsaw puzzle. I'm afraid the press might

<p>A brief letter today only today, when
<lb/>the b w was expecting to find 2 for him.
<lb/>Poor bw. I have a good many other letters to
<lb/>answer so shall make this my excuse for a
<lb/>short one too.</p>
<p>I can remember all the family birthdays
<lb/>Rex's Sept 4 <unclear>Mabs</unclear> Sept 6 Mater Sept 22
<lb/>? 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> <hi rend="underline">Wolfs Oct 6</hi> Eds Oct 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> but it is the
<lb/>extraneous events Eg engagement &amp; wedding anni-
<lb/>versaries pr's birthday etc which I have not
<lb/>yet got into yet!</p>
<!-- Written at the top of the letter -->
<p>Douglas who has
<lb/>been doing tea duty
<lb/>in the mess is to do
<lb/>4 days full duty in
<lb/>place of another orderly
<lb/>gone on leave. I thought
<lb/>he was not quite keen
<lb/>about it but think it
<lb/>was only a little hesitation.
<lb/>Certainly 4 days full
<lb/>work will be a good
<lb/>change as I think he
<lb/>hasn't enough to keep
<lb/>him occupied which it
<lb/>is his nature to be.</p>
