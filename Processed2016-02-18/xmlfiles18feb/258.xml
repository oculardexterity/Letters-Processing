                            <p>A letter from Sean T. O'Kelly (1882-1966) to James Ryan (1891-1970). The letter was written after Ryan's release from Frongach but while O'Kelly was still imprisoned and O'Kelly expresses his delight that Ryan had been released. The letter refers to personal and political affairs and mentions Gearoid O'Sullivan (who later became IRA adjutant general) and Michael Collins.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>James Ryan studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. Sean T. O'Kelly was a politician and later president of Ireland. He was arrested after the Rising and imprisoned first in Wandsworth the Woking, Frogach and Reading. O'Kelly married Ryan's sister Mary Kate (Kit in the letter) in 1918 and after her death he married another of Ryan's sisters, Phyllis.</p>

A Shéamuis Dhílis
Thanks very much for your letter and for the many interesting items of news it contained. I can quite well understand what a lively time you have had since your return to Dublin and how little chance there was for correspondence being indulged in. I was delighted when I learned, and through a casual remark in a letter of Kits' that you were free at last. I had almost begun to fear that you with Liam and Michael had been put on the blacklist and that you too were going to be an absentee from Tomcoole on the memorable 16th of August. It was a great relief to know then that you - at ?PON? and I both received the wedding cake yesterday - for which many thinks. There was a great run on it
NOTE IN LEFT MARGIN Give my regards to Dick when next you meet him

I read a most interesting and well written little article by him in last week's New Ireland, which someone managed to slip in here. How do you know nothing came of that St. Patrick's night feat. Have you been making enquiries? I never thought of asking ?Noyek? when I saw him in Wandsworth in June. Did you see any sign of Power while you were in town. You must have plied your opponents freely with the wine bottle when you managed to come out as successful. Kit said in her letter that "the bous won disgracefully" I must say I can't see anything disgraceful.in a win of over £5. How did Jack come off? Did he beat your record.

I was not surprised to hear of Lily's decision. All I hope is that she will find the life to her taste and be happy in it.
How are Mother and Father. I trust they are both in the best of form. What kind of weather are you having. It is broken and showery over here. I trust it keeps fine in Ireland till all the crops are in.
If I am to be here for Christmas - as some think I'll write and get you to send something for the Christmas dinner.

<salute>A Shéamuis Dhílis</salute></opener>
<p>Thanks very much
<lb/> for your letter and for the many
<lb/> interesting items of news it con&#x2014;
<lb/> tained. I can quite well under&#x2014;
<lb/> stand what a lively time you have
<lb/> had since your return to Dublin
<lb/> and how little chance there was for
<lb/> correspondence being indulged in.
<lb/> I was delighted when I learned, only
<lb/> through a casual remark in a letter
<lb/> of Kits' that you were free at last.
<lb/> I had almost begun to fear that
<lb/> you with Liam and Michael had
<lb/> been put on the blacklist and
<lb/> that you too were going to be an
<lb/> absentee from <unclear>Tomcoole</unclear> on the
<lb/> memorable 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of August. It was a
<lb/> great relief to know then that you at<lb/>
<lb/> Ron and I both received the
<lb/> wedding cake yesterday &#x2014; for which
<lb/> many thanks. There was a great run on it
<add>Give my regards to Dick when next you meet him</add>

            <lb/>At any rate we are going to be present
<lb/> to do your bit (looks like as if I
<lb/> should have <gap/><gap/>
<lb/> on the day of the great matrimonial
<lb/> double event. Kit sent me a
<lb/> most interesting and picturesque
<lb/> description of the event which to
<lb/> the great delight of all seems to
<lb/> have been an unbounded success.
<lb/> &#x2014; I wonder did poor Nell feel
<lb/> very bad of her enforced absence.
<lb/> Have you heard from her since?</p>
<p>The widow seems to have
<lb/> been terribly upset about missing
<lb/> you the day you called. She has
<lb/> written to me most voluminously
<lb/> on the subject several times and
<lb/> of course I sympathized and con&#x2014;
<lb/> soled most tenderly with her on
<lb/> her loss. Did you see O B. at

            <lb/>all before you left the camp. Had
<lb/> the camps been amalgamated 
<lb/> <gap/> You must have
<lb/> felt lonely leaving Gearoid and
<lb/> Mick C. Were you in the camp
<lb/> the day I came on here. Do you
<lb/> remember my namesake who
<lb/> came here  the same day. The poor
<lb/> fellow has since<del>deleted text</del> been put
<lb/> into a lunatic asylum &#x2014; looks
<lb/> hopeful for some of us eh &#x2014; or
<lb/> perhaps you might feel incl&#x2014;
<lb/> ined to say some other people you
<lb/> know should have been put
<lb/> into a similar place long ago.</p>
<p>Had you much talk with P.O C. at the <foreign><unclear>Oireachtas</unclear></foreign> .Did he say
<lb/> anything as to what he has been
<lb/> doing with himself for the past four
<lb/> months &#x2014; I wonder how he is
<lb/> managing to make ends meet

            <lb/>I read a most interesting
<lb/> and well written little article by
<lb/> him in last week's New Ireland,
<lb/> which someone managed to
<lb/> slip in here. How do you
<lb/> know nothing came of that St.
<lb/> Patrick's night feat. Have you
<lb/> been making enquiries?
<lb/>  I never thought of asking <unclear>Noyek</unclear>
<lb/> when I saw him in Wandsworth
<lb/> in June. Did you see any sign
<lb/> of Power while you were in town.</p>
<p>You must have plied your opponents
<lb/> freely with the wine bottle when you
<lb/> managed to come out as success&#x2014;
<lb/> fully. Kit said in her letter that
<lb/> "the boys won disgracefully" I must
<lb/> say I can't see anything disgraceful
<lb/> in a win of over £5. How did
<lb/> Jack come off? Did he beat
<lb/> your record.</p>

            <p>We had a big burst or blow
<lb/> out here last night. Some of
<lb/> the boys have been talking of it
<lb/> as a banquet. The occasion
<lb/> was my (21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>) birthday. I
<lb/> stood the spread which as you
<lb/> can imagine was not a very
<lb/> elaborate affair, all the same
<lb/> for the liquid department I
<lb/> managed to secure several
<lb/> bottles of wine &#x2014; <sic>tis</sic> true <sic>twas</sic>
<lb/> only or mostly white wine of a
<lb/> poor quality but it was called
<lb/> and labelled <foreign>Niersteiner</foreign>, &amp;
<lb/> <foreign>Hochheimer</foreign> and as the monkey
<lb/> said "Anything in hard times",
<lb/> likewise we had some
<lb/> Beaune and a fair supply of
<lb/> Guinness, Bass and Alsopps.
<lb/> The eatables consisted chiefly
        
    
         
        <pb n="671" facs="#L1916_258_img_671"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/> of sardines, preserved herrings with tom&#x2014;
<lb/> ato sauce and pickles, with biscuits,
<lb/> cakes, cheese, bread and butter, jam
<lb/> marmalade K.R &#x2014; and a liberal
<lb/> supply of smokes. Of course we
<lb/> had tea and coffee as well for the
<lb/> teetotallers &#x2014; who luckily were the
<lb/> big majority. We had of course
<lb/> any amount of toasts and speeches
<lb/> with songs and selections from
<lb/> the orchestra <add>(fiddle &amp; flute)</add> every now and then.
<lb/> Griffith proposed the toast of the
<lb/> night &#x2014; making the most of a poor
<lb/> cause and good speeches were
<lb/> delivered by Gen. Nicholls, O'Mally,
<lb/> <unclear>O'Gannpoiáin</unclear> and C. Shannon.
<lb/> The whole affair was most succ&#x2014;
<lb/> essful &#x2014; some of the boys even
<lb/> saying they never had a better
<lb/> night's fun. A parcel sent me<pb/>
<add>Remember me kindly to the "New 
<lb/> Curate" when next you see him.</add>

            <lb/>by the Widow containing a big
<lb/> cake from Bewleys and a box
<lb/> of cigarettes arrived in the nick
<lb/> of time and was a great addition
<lb/> to the table.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Widow
<lb/> reminds me that I had a
<lb/> letter and a box of fags from
<lb/> Pat Campion today and a
<lb/> similar reminder from Mollie
<lb/> Birmingham, so you can see
<lb/> I am being fairly well looked
<lb/> after.</p>
<p> I had a letter from K. Brady
<lb/> during the week in which she
<lb/> mentioned that Mairin would
<lb/> in all probability be coming
<lb/> over to England this year. Is
<lb/> this true. If so I would be
<lb/> really sorry. I sincerely sympathise
        
    
         
        <pb n="673" facs="#L1916_258_img_673"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/> with anyone who has perforce
<lb/> to leave Ireland to live in
<lb/> this Godforsaken land.</p>
<p> I was not surprised to
<lb/> hear of Lily's decision and what
<lb/> is more I thoroughly approve
<lb/> of her decision. All I hope is
<lb/> that she will find the life to her
<lb/> taste and be happy in it.</p>
<p> How are Mother and Father.
<lb/> I trust they are both in the best of form.
<lb/> What kind of weather are you
<lb/> having. It is broken and showery
<lb/> over here. I trust it keeps fine
<lb/> in Ireland till all the crops are in.</p>
<p> If I am to be here for Christmas &#x2014; as
<lb/> some think I'll write and get you to
<lb/> send something for the Christmas
<lb/> dinner. Ginger and Cole send kind&#x2014;
<lb/> est regards.</p>
