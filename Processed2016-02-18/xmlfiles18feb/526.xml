                            <p>In this letter, dated 30 July 1916, James O’Shea writes to Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929) to tell her of the unanimous opposition of the Public Boards of County Kerry to the execution of Roger Casement (who was charged with treason after being arrested just before the Easter Rising and alter hanged on 3 August 1916). He writes that he has signed a petition she had sent and suggests that she meet with the king, who O’Shea is sure can be convinced that granting Casement a reprieve will help foster a better relationship between Ireland and England.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Alice Stopford Green was an Irish historian and nationalist. While not a supporter of armed rebellion, her house provided a space for leading nationalists to meet. Stopford Green had collaborated with Roger Casement on Congo Reform and, after the Easter Rising in 1916, she tried to save him from execution</p>

Madam
I hope you received Petition signed by me on behalf of poor Sir Rodger. I could easily have got a million names attached. But as our Public Boards of Kerry are all unanimous in not having the execution & passed resolutions to that effect, we believe it ought to have more weight, with in authority, for they truly represent our people.

<salute>Madam</salute>
<p>I hope you received
<lb/> Petition signed by me on
<lb/> behalf of poor Sir Rodger.
<lb/> I could easily have got a
<lb/> million names attached.
<lb/> But as our Public Boards
<lb/> of Kerry are all unanimous
<lb/> in not having the execution
<lb/> &amp; passed resolutions to that
<lb/> effect, we believe it ought
<lb/> to have more weight, with
<lb/> in authority, for they truly
<lb/> represent our people. I
<lb/> enclose you one of those

<p>Oh, Dear Madam is
<lb/> <sic>their</sic>any chance you could

<lb/> the King, Surely the son

<lb/> be so hard hearted when
<lb/> we in Ireland, I for one
<lb/> believe was not refused

<lb/> if King Edward were alive

<lb/> of his Irish people and

<p>Madam I am now

<lb/> I represent them in various
