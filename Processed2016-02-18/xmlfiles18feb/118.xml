                            <p>Letter from a prisoner of war, B. Maguire, South Lancashire Regiment, to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Maguire was then incarcerated in Limburg, Germany. In the letter he writes that he has not yet received cigarettes that Lady Clonbrock had sent to him and remarks that while other men in the camp were receiving bread from Switzerland, he asks Lady Clonbrock to arrange this for him. Maguire also writes that he had not received a letter or parcel from his wife for 18 months and requests Lady Clonbrock to visit her to ascertain what is wrong.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (n√©e Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>
