                            <p>Letter from High Sheriff of County Galway, James R. Martin, to Sir Robert Chalmers (1858–1938), the under-secretary of Ireland.

                            <p>The high sheriff of County Galway was the sovereign's judicial representative in County Galway. Sir Robert Chalmers was sent to Ireland as replacement under-secretary for Sir Matthew Nathan, who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell, his chief secretary, following the outbreak of the Easter Rising in 1916.</p>

<lb/><salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>I would like to be allowed to express an
<lb/> opinion in the question of compensation for
<lb/> injuries sustained in this county &amp; the
<lb/> recent Sinn Fein rising. Many claims
<lb/> will be, &amp; I think have been put in by people
<lb/> who were thoroughly in sympathy with
<lb/> the rebels &amp; now make exorbitant claims
<lb/> for articles that they gave them of their 
<lb/>own free will.  Speaking broadly all
<lb/> the people in this locality were in sympathy
<lb/> with the rebels</p>
<p>Also people who were not in sympathy<pb/>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener>
<p>I would like to be allowed to express an
<lb/> opinion in the question of compensation for
<lb/> injuries sustained in this county &amp; the
<lb/> recent Sinn Fein rising. Many claims
<lb/> will be, &amp; I think have been put in by people
<lb/> who were thoroughly in sympathy with
<lb/> the rebels &amp; now make exorbitant claims
<lb/> for articles that they gave them of their 
<lb/>own free will.  Speaking broadly all
<lb/> the people in this locality were in sympathy
<lb/> with the rebels</p>
<p>Also people who were not in sympathy
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="3547" facs="#L1916_1360_img_3547"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>with them &amp; have sustained injuries are
<lb/>putting in exorbitant claims. I take from 
<lb/> the 'Galway Express' of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with three 
<lb/>claims one for £160 one for £288.8.0
<lb/> &amp; one for £50 &amp; my belief is that these
 <lb/> amounts are enormously in excess of the 
<lb/> value of the damage sustained. </p>
<p> If I may be allowed to further express an 
<lb/> opinion as to this county, for which I am
 <lb/> responsible, I would like to say that the 
<lb/> leaders of this rising <add>in Co. Galway</add> several of whom have
 <lb/> not as yet been apprehended, are all men 
<lb/> well known to the police, and have for
<lb/> years kept this County in a state of disturbance 
<lb/> &amp; have been at the bottom of all outrages, 
<lb/>  &amp; are the recipients of German money. 
<lb/> It is their constant endeavour to keep the
 <lb/> County disturbed as if it becomes peaceful
 <lb/> their occupation &amp; means of living are gone to 
<lb/> great extent, owning to them for many years
        
    
         
        <pb n="3548" facs="#L1916_1360_img_3548"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/> No one in this County has been able to embark
<lb/> on  any kind of business without first finding 
<lb/> an answer to the question; "If this business
<lb/> is successful shall I be allowed to carry it on".</p>
<p> I need hardly point out the advantage of 
<lb/> putting such disturbers of the public peace 
<lb/> in a position in which they will be no longer
 <lb/> harmful.</p>
<p> I may perhaps also draw your attention
 <lb/> to another point some of the men who have
 <lb/> turned out as rebels, some of which are not
 <lb/> yet apprehended, have received from the
 <lb/> conjested district board excellent farms in
 <lb/> the vicinity of Athenry, &amp; no doubt elsewhere, 
<lb/> &amp; grants of money to build houses.  Some 
<lb/> have received these things quite recently.  It 
<lb/> is obviously not right that these men should
<lb/> be allowed to retain these farms or pass 
<lb/> them on to their friends &amp; relations.</p>
