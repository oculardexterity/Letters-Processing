                            <p>A letter from Charles Munro (1869-1952) , governor of Mountjoy prison, to Mabel FitzGerald (n√©e Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). The letter is a response to queries from Mabel regarding a proposed visit to her husband during his imprisonment in Mountjoy.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week. Charles Arthur Munro was the governor of Mountjoy prison in Dublin. He is also the brother of the noted author H.H. Munro, better known through his literary pseudonym, Saki.</p>

From the Governor, H.M.Prison, Mountjoy, Dublin.
2nd. February, 1916
To Mrs.Mabel Fitzgerald, 2 Loretto Villas, Bray.
With reference to your letter of 1st. instant, I have to inform you that you will be entitled to visit your husband on Saturday next, the 5th. inst., and that the period of the visit may extend to half an hour. Your husband states he would like to see <del>deleted text</del>Einar O'Duffy, or one of his friends.
A baby in arms does not count as a visitor. If possible, it would be more convenient for the visit to take place in the forenoon, but if Saturday is an inconvenient day, I may mention that your husband states Monday would be an equally suitable day for him.

<p>With reference to your letter of 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> instant, I have to inform you that you
<lb/> will be entitled to visit your husband on Saturday next, the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst., and that
<lb/> the period of the visit may <sic>extendto</sic> half an hour. Your husband states he
<lb/> would like to see <gap/> Einar O'Duffy, or one of his friends.</p>
<p>A baby in arms does not count as a visitor. If possible, it would be more
<lb/> convenient for the visit to take place in the forenoon, but if Saturday is an
<lb/> inconvenient <add>day,</add> I may mention that your husband states Monday would be an equally
<lb/> suitable day for him <add>arriving</add>.</p>
