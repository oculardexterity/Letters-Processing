                            <p>Letter from Nancy Campbell to Mabel FitzGerald (1884-1957). Mrs. Campbell feels sure that there will be pressure put on the British by America. She feels that all of the prisoners will be released at the end of the war and urges Mrs FitzGerald to remain hopeful. She mentions a vacant house (in her area) which she suggests Mrs. FitzGerald might take for the summer. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Nancy Campbell, neé Maude, (b. 23 May 1886) was the daughter of Colonel Aubrey Maude, Cameronian Highlanders. Nancy met the poet Joseph Campbell (1879 – 1944) during a visit to Ireland in 1909 and married him in May 1910 whereupon Nancy became completely estranged from her family. Mabel Fitzgerald was the wife of Irish Volunteer Desmond Fitzgerald (1888-1947).  Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>
