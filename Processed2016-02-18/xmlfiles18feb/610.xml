                            <p>A letter from Michael Collins (1890-1922) to his cousin Nancy O'Brien (who later married his brother) written from Frongach Internment Camp in Wales. In the letter he discusses conditions at the camp and the release of Irish prisoners, although he does not think he will be counted as one of their number. He also refers to mutual friends. </p>

He went on to become Minister for Finance in the First DÃ¡il, IRA Director of Information and President of the Provisional Government.</p>

Dear Nancy,
Honestly I don't know whether or not I've written to you since receiving a letter from you about a week ago. In any case since comint to this place my correspondence has gone all wary for as I've told you already we are only allowed two letters weekly or when you add to this several others sent away surreptitiosly, many of which have not been delivered - the muddle is clearly understood.
Taking all things into account I suppose we have no reason to complain - at any rate I don't. Of course the huts may be overcrowded other visiting arrangement very inadequate & several other things but even so, in this weather pretty surroundings there are compensations and we might very easily have been lying cold and stiff or in Dartmoor etc ~~- Just at this moment I suppose you are about to depart for the south. How I'd like going! Has Hannie returned yet? Well I hope you'll have a right good time if you need a body who takes an interest in you - can say how well I

amm & for some time my only concern was about these proposals. I'm glad to see that this particulalr business has been dropped. 
Surely John E & Co must be dispirited now, although there are a lot of damn fools knocking about. At present there is great excitement in these 'compunds; about the releases - about 40 r 50 daily. One never knows what mistake a Gov Dep might might make. Between you and me I don't think I'm likely to see the shores of Erin for some time.
Now how are your colleagues goin on? Have written several times to Susan,.   some of the letters I already allude to may not have arrrived, but I have not had a note from her for some time. Dolly has not written either but she sends the Independent. 
I'd be obliged if you'd just say a word of thanks on my behalf. Your cigarts came alright and were very good. The Govt is much better than we were as to m.d. But its not possible to get anything as as fruit or any kind of decent cake etc. There is a Canteen - a dry one unhappily! Where we may get something in addition to the allowances. I suppose you know Eugene O'Keefe is here. Very well and in good form.
Much love
Michael

<salute>My Dear Nancy,</salute>
<p>Honestly I don't know whether or not

<lb/> about a week ago. In any case since coming to

<lb/> as <sic>Ive</sic> told you already we are only allowed two
<lb/> letters weekly &amp; when you add to this several
<lb/> others sent away surreptitiously, many of which
<lb/> have not been delivered &#x2014; the muddle
<lb/> is clearly understood.</p>
<p>Taking all things into account
<lb/> I suppose we have no reason to complain - at
<lb/> any rate I <sic>dont.</sic> Of course the huts may be
<lb/> overcrowded &amp; the  visiting arrangements very inadequate
<lb/> &amp; several other things but even so, in this weather
<lb/> &amp; pretty surroundings there are compensations and
<lb/> we might very easily have been lying cold and

<lb/> I suppose you are about to depart for the south.
<lb/> How <sic>Id</sic> like to be going! Has Hannie returned

<salute>My Dear Nancy,</salute></opener>
<p>Honestly I don't know whether or not
<lb/> <sic>Ive</sic> written to you since receiving a letter from you
<lb/> about a week ago. In any case since coming to
<lb/> this place my correspondence has gone all awry for
<lb/> as <sic>Ive</sic> told you already we are only allowed two
<lb/> letters weekly &amp; when you add to this several
<lb/> others sent away surreptitiously, many of which
<lb/> have not been delivered &#x2014; the muddle
<lb/> is clearly understood.</p>
<p>Taking all things into account
<lb/> I suppose we have no reason to complain - at
<lb/> any rate I <sic>dont.</sic> Of course the huts may be
<lb/> overcrowded &amp; the  visiting arrangements very inadequate
<lb/> &amp; several other things but even so, in this weather
<lb/> &amp; pretty surroundings there are compensations and
<lb/> we might very easily have been lying cold and
<lb/> stiff or in Dartmoor etc &#x2014; Just at this moment
<lb/> I suppose you are about to depart for the south.
<lb/> How <sic>Id</sic> like to be going! Has Hannie returned

            <lb/>am &amp; for some time my <del>I</del> only concern was
<lb/> about these proposals. <sic>Im</sic> glad to see that
<lb/> this particular business has been dropped.
<lb/> Surely John E &amp; Co must be dispirited now, although
<lb/> there are a lot of damn fools knocking about. At
<lb/> present there is great excitement in this 'compound'
<lb/> about the releases - about 40 or 50 daily. One never
<lb/> knows what mistake a Gov Dep might might make;  &amp;
<lb/> between you and me I <sic>dont</sic> think I'm likely to see the
<lb/> shores of Erin for some time.</p>
<p>Now how are your colleagues going
<lb/> on? Have written several times to Susan, often
<lb/> some of the letters <add>those already alluded to</add> may not have arrived, but have
<lb/> not had a note from her for some time. Dolly has

<lb/> <sic>Id</sic> be obliged if <sic>youd</sic> just say a word of thanks to her

<lb/> very good. The grub is much better than we were used
