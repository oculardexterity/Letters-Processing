                            <p>Letter from a prisoner of war, B. Maguire, South Lancashire Regiment, to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Maguire was then incarcerated in Limberg, Germany. He writes that he has not yet received cigarettes that Lady Clonbrock had sent and asks her to arrange for him to be sent some bread as he had not got any from the Irish Women's Association, owing to his being in an English, rather than an Irish, regiment. Maguire writes that he has not been receiving regular letters from his wife and that this has his lowered his spirits; he ask Lady Clonbrock to enquire.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>
