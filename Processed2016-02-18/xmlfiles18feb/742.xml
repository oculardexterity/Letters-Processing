                            <p>A letter from John Dillon (1851-1927) to sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859 - 1929).  In this letter Dillon welcomes the fact that Maxwell has enlisted the services of Captain Crean who is aware of the National Volunteers and can help with the cases Dillon has sent to him.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>John Dillon was an Irish Party M.P. in the House of Commons. Dillon issued a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 condemning the British handling of the Rising which had been put down “with so much blood and so much savagery,” and called for an immediate end to the executions. Dillon would succeed John Redmond as leader of the Home Rule party in 1918. Sir John Henry Grenfell Maxwell was appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising. Before 1916, Maxwell briefly held command of British troops in Egypt, where he successfully organised defences against a Turkish attack in February 1915 and presided over the huge expansion of his command as Egypt became a major British imperial military base. In March 1916, having been superseded as general officer commanding in Egypt, he was recalled home when the Easter Rising broke out.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir John Maxwell</salute></opener>
<p>I beg to thank you
<lb/> for your letter of 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst.
<lb/>I am very glad to hear
<lb/> that you have enlisted
<lb/> the services of Captain
<lb/> Crean &#x2014; He knows all
<lb/>l about the National
<lb/> Volunteers.</p>
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="1936" facs="#L1916_742_img_1936"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>Enclosed are particulars of
<lb/> some cases &#x2014; I am
<lb/> assured by reliable friends
<lb/> that two men mentioned 
<lb/>in enclosed letters have
<lb/> had no connection with 
<lb/>the Insurrection - or with
<lb/> the Organisations who
<lb/> prepared it.</p>
<p>I feel bound to renew
<lb/> my <hi rend="underline">earnest</hi> protest
<lb/> against the continued
<lb/> military executions.
        
    
         
        <pb n="2111" facs="#L1916_742_img_2111"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>The list in this evenings
<lb/> paper has given a
<lb/> very severe shock to
<lb/> a large section of the people
<lb/> who are good friends of
<lb/> the Government &#x2014; And who
<lb/> were utterly opposed to
<lb/> the <unclear>Irish</unclear> doings of
 <lb/>last week. &#x2014; The
<lb/> feeling is becoming
<lb/> widespread and intensely 
<lb/>bitter  -&#x2014; It really
        
    
         
        <pb n="2112" facs="#L1916_742_img_2112"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>could be difficult to
<lb/> exaggerate the
<lb/> amount of mischief that
<lb/> the executions are
<lb/> doing.</p>
<p>As you kindly invite
<lb/> advice &#x2014; there are two
<lb/> other matters I feel I
<lb/> ought to mention to
<lb/>you &#x2014;
<lb/>I.</p>
<p> I do not believe
<lb/> it is a wise measure
        
    
         
        <pb n="2113" facs="#L1916_742_img_2113"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>to arm special Constables &#x2014;
<lb/> they are not required &#x2014;
<lb/> and seem to be quite ineffective
<lb/> &#x2014; and in the present
<lb/> temper in the city they
<lb/> are very apt in my 
<lb/>opinion to create disturbance.</p>
<p>II. I very much doubt
<lb/> the wisdom of
<lb/> instituting searches
<lb/> and arrests in a large
        
    
         
        <pb n="2114" facs="#L1916_742_img_2114"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>scale in districts in which
<lb/> there has been no
<lb/> disturbance.</p>
