                            <p>The letter is from E. Blackwell of the Home Office in London to Gertrude Bannister (later Parry), a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising.  Blackwell writes on behalf of the secretary of state for the Home Office, Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel (1870-1963). He advises that after a petition from Bannister relating to Casement's sentence Simon has decided that there were no grounds for him to interfere in the matter.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. Casement was hanged on 3 August 1916, the day after the letter was written.</p>

Madam,

I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform
you that he has given careful consideration to the Petition
submitted by you on behalf of Roger David Casement, now under
sentence of death, and I am to express to you his deep regret
that after considering all the circumstances of the case he
has failed to discover any grounds which would justify him in
advising His Majesty to interfere with the due course of law.
I am,

<salute>Madam,</salute></opener>
<p>I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform
<lb/> you that he has given careful consideration to the Petition
<lb/> submitted by you on behalf of Roger David Casement, now under
<lb/> sentence of death, and I am to express to you his deep regret
<lb/> that after considering all the circumstances of the case he
<lb/> has failed to discover any grounds which would justify him in
<lb/> advising His Majesty to interfere with the due course of law.</p>

<lb/>Madam,
