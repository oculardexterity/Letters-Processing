                            <p>A letter from Sean T. O"Kelly (1882-1966) to James Ryan (1891-1970). The letter was written after Ryan's release from Frongach but while O'Kelly was still imprisoned. The letter refers to a visit from Mary Kate (who looked 'tired') and another of Ryan's sisters, Min, and asks Ryan to send his regards to Phyllis.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>James Ryan studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. Sean T. O'Kelly was a politician and later president of Ireland. He was arrested after the Rising and imprisoned first in Wandsworth the Woking, Frogach and Reading. O'Kelly married Ryan's sister Mary Kate (Kit in the letter) in 1918 and after her death he married another of Ryan's sisters, Phyllis.</p>

Thanks for your last very interesting epistle. I am wondering if you succeeded in your design of getting up to Dublin and back. I hope you got up in time to see our vivacious friend before her departure anyhow. Give her my kindest regards when you are writing again.
Kit, Min? and Fr. M have been here since last I wrote to you and I need not tell you how happy we were to see them. It was a great relief to see Min? again. I was anxious about for the last few weeks. Martin and Min? looked in the pink but Kit I thought looked a bit tired and worn. Art O'Brien was with me yesterday and I am in hopes of seeing Miss L.G.Duffy tomorrow when she comes to visit Ginger.
I wrote to Liam yesterday. The letter was wholly in Irish. I sent it as a test. I hope he gets it safely. I had a long letter from "the Widow" today - just as usual. Remember me to Phyllis. I hope to write to her soon. I know she is up to her eyes in work and can't Write. 
This place (words crossed out) resembles a monastery too much for good stories to flourish inside its precincts. You'd be put in the clink I believe if you only whispered the word "Monkey".

<p>Kit, <unclear>Min</unclear> and Fr. M have been here since last

<lb/> I was very anxious about her for the last few weeks.
<lb/> Martin and <unclear>Min</unclear> looked in the pink but Kit I thought
<lb/> looked a bit tired and worn. Art O'Brien was
<lb/> with me yesterday and I am in hopes of seeing Miss L.
<lb/> G.Duffy tomorrow when she comes to visit Ginger.</p>
<p> I wrote to Liam yesterday. The letter was
<lb/> wholly in Irish. I sent it as a test. I hope he gets it
<lb/> safely. I had a long letter from "the Widow" today &#x2014; just
<lb/> as usual. Remember me to Phyllis. I hope to write to
<lb/> her soon. I know she is up to her eyes in work and can't
<lb/> write. This place <del>deleted text</del> resembles a

<p>Thanks for your last very
<lb/> interesting epistle. I am wondering if you
<lb/> succeeded in your design of getting up to Dublin
<lb/> and back. I hope you got up in time to see our
<lb/> vivacious friend before her departure anyhow.
<lb/> Give her my kindest regards when you are writing
<lb/> again.</p>
<p>Kit, <unclear>Min</unclear> and Fr. M have been here since last
<lb/> I wrote to you and I need not tell you how happy we were
<lb/> to see them. It was a great relief to see <unclear>Min</unclear> again.
<lb/> I was very anxious about her for the last few weeks.
<lb/> Martin and <unclear>Min</unclear> looked in the pink but Kit I thought
<lb/> looked a bit tired and worn. Art O'Brien was
<lb/> with me yesterday and I am in hopes of seeing Miss L.
<lb/> G.Duffy tomorrow when she comes to visit Ginger.</p>
<p> I wrote to Liam yesterday. The letter was
<lb/> wholly in Irish. I sent it as a test. I hope he gets it
<lb/> safely. I had a long letter from "the Widow" today &#x2014; just
<lb/> as usual. Remember me to Phyllis. I hope to write to
<lb/> her soon. I know she is up to her eyes in work and can't
<lb/> write. This place <del>deleted text</del> resembles a
<lb/> monastery too much for good stories to flourish inside
<lb/> its precincts. You'd be put in the clink I believe if
<lb/> you only whispered the word "Monkey".</p>
