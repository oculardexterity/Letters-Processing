                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968).  In this letter, Spender gives an account of his settling into his new position and his workload. He discusses the local surroundings, the character of the Corps Commander, and his own recent promotion, which he believes will be only temporary.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender  was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<p>For some reason I did not
<lb/> sleep very well last night &amp; had
<lb/> to make an <del>very</del> early rise to drive
<lb/> up to the German lines so am not in a <del>pos</del> <add>con</add>dition to write much.</p>
 <p>Gradually I am picking up my
<lb/> work but it is still indefinite 
<lb/>&amp; of course in a new area  am
<lb/> feels strange tho' it is not quite
<lb/>as new country as the North
<lb/> was. No letter for 3 days
<lb/>a very hungry b w. </p>
<p>Last night &amp; this morning
<lb/> I was up at a Captured  German 
<lb/>village which has been very
<lb/>much in evidence lately, A more
<lb/> mournful sight one has  never
<lb/>seen debris dust debris dust
<lb/>Pompeii was not in it with

            <lb/>no man's land where many young
<lb/> rather uncommon wildflowers
<lb/> had taken the chance of man's
<lb/> absence to start a home. Rather
<lb/> a mistake I'm afraid as it 
<lb/> will soon be as dusty &amp; 
<lb/> full as the rest of the country. </p>  
<p>My Corps Commander is Gen
<lb/> Horn, who has a big reputation
<lb/> as a strong man, probably
<lb/> rather silent. I have seen
<lb/> little of him but have been
<lb/> moved to the A mess today
<lb/> so shall see more presumably.</p>
<p>I fancy I am more or
<lb/>less under trial &amp; may find 
<lb/>myself being transferred to 
<lb/> a Division if not found wanting. </p>
