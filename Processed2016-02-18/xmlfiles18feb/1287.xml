Langan writes that he will be forwarding the statements of 106 officials from the Dublin Excise Collection as to their whereabouts during the Easter Rising. Langan adds that due to the office remaining closed until Thursday and the restricted postal facilities he is missing ten statements which will be forwarded on later.</p>

Collector of Customs & Excise
CUSTOMS AND EXCISE OFFICE,
Excise Branch,
Custom House, Dublin.
6 May, 1916
Sir,
In compliance with your letter dated the 1st. May, I beg to forward statements made by 106 officials in Dublin (Excise) Collection.
As this office was not reopened until Thursday the 4th. instant, I did not receive the above letter until that day; and in view of the restricted Postal facilities, the time between Thursday and Saturday at noon is scarcely sufficient for getting statements from the whole of the officials who are scattered all over the Dublin area from Clontarf to Rathmines, and Chapelizod to Pembroke. I am consequently unable to send statements from ten officials, but these will be forwarded later on.
So far as I can ascertain I believe the statements now forwarded give correct accounts of the movements of the persons concerned.
I beg to point out that there are two Collectors of Customs and Excise with offices in this building, and I am informed that the Collector of the Customs Branch has not been favoured with a copy of the letter of the 1st. instant. As this may be due to oversight I feel it right to mention the matter.
I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant
J. Langan
Collector (Excise)
<note>I Send copy of letter of 1st inst. to Collector of C&Ex., Customs Branch. II Chief <gap/> 8/5/16</note

<opener><address><addrLine>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE OFFICE,</addrLine>

<dateline><date>6 May, 1916</date></dateline>
<salute>Sir,</salute></opener>
<p>In compliance with your letter dated the 1st. May, I beg to
<lb/> forward statements made by 106 officials in Dublin (Excise) 
<lb/>Collection.</p>
<p>As this office was not reopened until Thursday
<lb/> the 4th. instant, I did not receive the above letter until that
<lb/> day; and in view of the restricted Postal facilities, the time
<lb/> between Thursday and Saturday at noon is scarcely sufficient for
<lb/> getting statements from the whole of the officials who are scattered
<lb/> all over the Dublin area from Clontarf to Rathmines, and Chapelizod
<lb/> to Pembroke. I am consequently unable to send statements from 
<lb/><add>ten</add> officials, but these will be forwarded later on.</p>
<p>So far as I can ascertain I believe the statements now 
<lb/>forwarded give correct accounts of the movements of the persons
<lb/> concerned.</p>
<p>I beg to point out that there are two Collectors of Customs
<lb/> and Excise with offices in this building, and I am informed that 
<lb/>the Collector of the Customs Branch has not been favoured with a 
<lb/>copy of the letter of the 1st. instant. As this may be due to
<lb/> oversight I feel it right to mention the matter.
<salute>I am, Sir,
<lb/>Your obedient servant</salute>
<signed>J. Langan
<lb/>Collector (Excise)</signed>

<address>Sir Matthew Nathan
<lb/>Chief Secretary's Office
<lb/>Dublin Castle.</address>

<note>I Send copy of letter of 
<lb/>1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> inst. to Collector of C&Ex.,
<lb/> Customs Branch.
<lb/> II Chief Commissioner
