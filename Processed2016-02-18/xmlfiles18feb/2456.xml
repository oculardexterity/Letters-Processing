<salute>Dear Mr. Cockran:</salute>
<p>We have started an Irish Relief Fund Committee and at a conference last night with Arch bishop Glennon it was agreed by all that it would be most desirable to have you speak here for the Cause some time during this month. Our people are neither so numerous nor so enthusiastic here as in your own City or Philadelphia or Chicago and need inspiration such as only you can give. A great number would come to hear you who would probably not attend to hear any other speaker and we believe we could give you a reception that would that would be in every way worthy of the Cause and of yourself.I <sic>earneatly</sic> hope that you can comply with our request and that you will send me a line or a wire at the earliest possible moment advising me what date you will find convenient to be here.</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Cockran:</salute>

<p>We have started an Irish Relief Fund
<lb/> Committee and at a conference last night with Arch
<lb/>bishop Glennon it was agreed by all that it would be
<lb/> most desirable to have you speak here for the Cause
<lb/> some time during this month. Our people are neither
<lb/> so numerous nor so enthusiastic here as in your own
<lb/> City or Philadelphia or Chicago and need inspiration
<lb/> such as only you can give. A great number would come
<lb/> to hear you who would probably not attend to hear any
<lb/> other speaker and we believe we could give you a reception
<lb/> that would that would be in every way worthy of the Cause
<lb/> and of yourself.I  earnestly  hope that you can comply
<lb/>  with our request and that you will send me a line or
<lb/> a wire at the earliest possible moment advising me what
<lb/> date you will find convenient to be here.</p>
<p>I shall always recall with pleasure
<lb/> the hours we were together in Chicago and the almost
<lb/> magical  way in which the crowds were parted to let us
<lb/> get to  and from the reviewing stand. With cordial good
<lb/> wishes</p>
