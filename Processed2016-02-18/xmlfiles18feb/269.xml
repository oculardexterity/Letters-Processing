                            <p>A letter from Mairín Ní Ribhógh to James Ryan (1891-1970). Mairín writes to welcome Ryan back to Ireland after his release from Frongach and enquires about some of his colleagues who had also been imprisoned. Mairín also asks about Ryan's sister Phyllis who had recently taken an exam and fills him in on some other personal events.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>James Ryan studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.</p>

2nd August 1916

Cead Mile Failte back to Ireland! Believe me I was glad to see by ?Doc's? letter this morning that you are coming home!  How glad your mother & father and all the others will be to have you back! Have Des Ryan & Dore & all the other college folk who were along with you, been equally lucky? Is there any chance of Liam

I did not see the results and forgot to ask Doc about it, but I hope and believe that she was successful.

<lb/><salute>Dear Jim</salute>
<p>Cead Mile Failte back
<lb/> to Ireland! Believe me
<lb/> I was delighted to see
<lb/> by Doc's letter this morning
<lb/> that you are coming home!
<lb/>  How glad your mother &amp;
<lb/> father and all the rest
<lb/> will be to have you back!
<lb/> Have Des Ryan &amp; Dore &amp;
<lb/> all the other college folk
<lb/> who were along with
<lb/> you, been equally lucky?
<lb/> Is there any chance of Liam<pb/>

<salute>Dear Jim</salute>
<p>Cead Mile Failte back
<lb/> to Ireland! Believe me
<lb/> I was delighted to see
<lb/> by Doc's letter this morning
<lb/> that you are coming home!
<lb/>  How glad your mother &amp;
<lb/> father and all the rest
<lb/> will be to have you back!
<lb/> Have Des Ryan &amp; Dore &amp;
<lb/> all the other college folk
<lb/> who were along with
<lb/> you, been equally lucky?
<lb/> Is there any chance of Liam
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="715" facs="#L1916_269_img_715"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>O'Brien being released
<lb/> soon? I wish you'd send
<lb/> me his address, I want to
<lb/> write to him but don't know
<lb/> for certain where he is.</p> 
<p>How did Phyllis get on at
<lb/> her exam? I did not
<lb/> see the results and forgot
<lb/> to ask Doc about it, but
<lb/> I hope and believe that
<lb/> she was successful.</p>
<p> Doc &amp; Eily McGrane paid
<lb/> me a flying visit as soon
<lb/> as they had finished
<lb/> a pilgrimage to Lough
<lb/> Derg. We motored to Sligo
<lb/> one day, while they were
<lb/> here and besieged Godfrey,
<lb/> he is just as fat &amp; jolly as
<lb/> ever!</p>

            <p>Now I must say
<lb/> good evening
<lb/> with love to Phyllis Miss
<lb/> Ryan Agnes &amp; yourself
<lb/> &amp; kindest regards to
<lb/> Father Regan.</p>
