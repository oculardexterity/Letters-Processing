                            <p>A letter from Anna O'Rahilly (d. 1958) to Mabel Fitzgerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). The letter refers to a bicycle borrowed by FitzGerald to get to the GPO on the first day of the Rising. Anna enquires about its possible whereabouts on behalf of O'Rahilly's wife. A note dated March 1992 explains what happened to the bicycle.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Anna O'Rahilly was a sister of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly ('The O'Rahilly') (1875–1916). Both O'Rahilly and FitzGerald had been supportive of attempts to stop the Rising taking place but joined in once it has started. O'Rahilly was killed in Moore Lane on Thursday of Easter week. Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 -1916) during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

Dear Mrs Fitzgerald,
My sister in law asked me to write to you about the bicycle that Mr Fitzgerald took that fatal morning to go to the post office perhaps by chance Mr Fitzgerald did not bring it to there - you said something about meeting him & that you walked together to the office - Could he possibly have left the bicycle in some other place where it might be now safe

The tyre had burst in Mill Town while Desmond was on his way to Rathfarnham to tell MacNeill that the Rising was on and Desmond had abandoned it there.

<salute>Dear Mrs Fitzgerald</salute></opener>
<p>My sister in law asked me
<lb/> to write to you about the bicycle
<lb/> that Mr Fitzgerald took that fatal
<lb/> morning to go to the post office
<lb/> Perhaps by chance Mr Fitzgerald
<lb/> did not bring it to there - you
<lb/> said something about meeting
<lb/> him &amp; that you walked together
<lb/> to the office - Could he possibly
<lb/> have left the bicycle in some other
<lb/> place where it might be now safe

            <lb/>Mac lost his cycle since so
<lb/> they are badly off for one
<lb/> now.</p>
<salute>With kind regards I am
Yours <sic>vy</sic> sincerely</salute>
