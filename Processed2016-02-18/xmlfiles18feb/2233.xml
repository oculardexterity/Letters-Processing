                            <p>A letter from Henry Charles Fitzmaurice (1845-1927) to Lady Londonderry (1878-1959). This letter refers to Lansdowne's expectation that Lady Londonderry will have been disappointed by the 'Dorsetshire decision'. He writes so that Lady Londonderry knows that he is 'not indifferent'.  </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a series of correspondence belonging to Lady Londonderry, the wife of Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart (1852-1915), sixth marquess of Londonderry. Lady Londonderry was appointed colonel-in-chief of the Women's Volunteer Reserve also an active figure in British politics. Her correspondence includes many important figures in literature, the arts, the military, law and the church.  This letter was written by Henry Charles Keith Petty Fitzmaurice, fifth marquess of Lansdowne, a prominent British politician who served in the wartime coalition ministry of H.H. Asquith. Lansdowne came to believe that victory in the war was impossible and his views o the matter led to the collapse of the government in December 1916. On 29 November 1917 he published his views in the 'Lansdowne Letter'.</p>
