                            <p>The letter is from Fred Allan (1861-1937), a member of the Irish National Aid Association. The letter refers to the printing of a card with an image of Patrick and William Pearse, executed after the Easter Rising. The card would be sold to raise funds. Allen also asks about a piece of music that would be printed in pamphlet form for the same reason.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>The association was founded after the Rising to provide relief to the dependents of those who were executed, killed in the fighting or had lost their employment. It later merged with the Irish Volunteer Dependents' Fund to form the Irish National Aid and Volunteer Dependents' Fund. Frederick James Allen was an Irish Nationalist and republican. During the Parnell era, Allan was one of the most influential and powerful men in the IRB. He later resigned from the organisation in 1912. Allan opposed the 1916 Rising, viewing it as a futile gesture, yet he would go on to be heavily involved in the politics of the Irish War of Independence.</p>

Fred. J.Allan, Secretary and Commercial Manager
28 June 1916

Dear Mr. Walker
I send you herewith the ?block? of the Brothers Pearse. Will you please give the copyright at once for the Irish National Aid Asso., as a proof might be shipped out from the engravers. Then as soon as possible we'd be glad to have a frilll or two on the size of card we arranged so that we can arrange the letter-press accordingly.
Can you manage to give us frills in different inks? The black looks very cold. We expect to have an immense run and will go for a first edition of 5000. 
Yours Very Truly
Fred G.Allan
<note>How are you getting on with the piece of music? Glad if you can ring me up between 4.30 & 5.</note>
