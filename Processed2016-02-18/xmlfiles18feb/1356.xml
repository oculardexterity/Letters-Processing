                            <p>A letter from  James H. Hampton (1858-1931) to Robert Chalmers (1858-1938), the under-secretary for Ireland. In the letter Hampton complains about receiving a Roman Catholic pastoral letter which was forwarded by the Chief Secretary's Office, despite the fact he is a member of the Church of Ireland. He goes on to state that considering the position of the Bishop of Limerick, Edward Thomas O'Dwyer (1842-1917) who openly supported the Rising, the government should not be forwarding such letters, or at least keep them within the Catholic community. He goes on to state that the issue will be brought to the House of Commons if it occurs again.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Robert Chalmers was sent to Ireland as replacement under-secretary for Sir Matthew Nathan, who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell, his chief secretary, following the outbreak of the Easter Rising in 1916.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>
<lb/>I received today from the Chief Secretary's Office 
<lb/>a Pastoral letter on Thrift by the Roman Catholic 
<lb/>Bishop of Meath. I have not read the Pastoral 
<lb/>nor do I intend to do so. I consider that an 
<lb/>unwarranted insult has been offered to me, as a 
<lb/>clergyman of the Church of Ireland, in sending 
<lb/>me a Pastoral by a Roman Catholic Bishop. 
<lb/>I am especially since it was forwarded "On His Majesty's Service".
<lb/>When I consider the attitude taken up by the Roman 
<lb/>Catholic Bishop of Limerick with reference to the 
<lb/>Sinn Fein <gap/>ation and the recent rebellion, one would imagine that His Majesty's Government would 
<lb/>have something better to do than to send Roman Catholic 
<lb/>Pastorals <gap/> throughout the country, and that 
<lb/>they would at least confine them to the members of 
<lb/>their own Communion. If any such literature is forwarded 
<lb/>to me again, I shall take steps to have the matter raised 
<lb/>in the House of Commons.

<salute>Yours faithfully,</salute>

<salute>Sir,</salute>

<p>I received today from the Chief Secretary's Office 
<lb/>a Pastoral letter on Thrift by the Roman Catholic 
<lb/>Bishop of Meath. I have not read the Pastoral 
<lb/>nor do I intend to do so. I consider that an 
<lb/>unwarranted insult has been offered to me, as a 
<lb/>clergyman of the Church of Ireland, in sending 
<lb/>me a Pastoral by a Roman Catholic Bishop, 
<lb/>I am especially since it was forwarded "On His Majesty's Service".
<lb/>When I consider the attitude taken up by the Roman 
<lb/>Catholic Bishop of Limerick with reference to the 
<lb/>Sinn Fein <unclear>inflammation</unclear> and the recent rebellion, one 
<lb/>would imagine that His Majesty's Government would 
<lb/>have something better to do than to send Roman Catholic 
<lb/>Pastorals <gap/> throughout the country, and that 
<lb/>they would at least confine them to the members of 
<lb/>their own Communion. If any such literature is forwarded 
<lb/>to me again, I shall take steps to have the matter raised 
<lb/>in the House of Commons.</p>

<salute>Yours faithfully,</salute>
