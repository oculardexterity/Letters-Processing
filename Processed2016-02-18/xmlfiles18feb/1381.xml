                            <p>Letter from Kate English (b. 1855) to her son Patrick (1894-1970). Kate writes concerning parcels that she had sent to Patrick and mentions additional packages that she intends sending to him. She writes about what is happening in Dublin, mentioning Patrick's brother David and a young boarder in their home Laurence Godfrey. Kate continues that she is lonely at home and raises the possibility of house-keeping for David Shandl. The letter ends with Patrick's siblings sending their love.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter was written by Kate  to Patrick English while he was interned. Patrick had been stationed in the G.P.O for the Rising. Following the surrender he was sent to Stafford Prison before being moved to Frongoch internment camp in Wales. He had at least six cousins fighting with the British Army in France during his incarceration.</p>
