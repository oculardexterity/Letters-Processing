                            <p>This letter is from a brigadier-general on the general staff of the British army in Ireland, writing on behalf of Sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859-1929) to William Henry Brayden (1865-1933) the editor of the 'Freeman's Journal'. The letter complains about a number of articles which appeared in the 'Freeman's Journal', a nationalist newspaper, which he claims were aimed at criticising martial law and fostering sympathy for those who took up arms, or plotted to do so, during the Rising. It explains that articles of that nature will not be tolerated and action may be taken under the Defence of the Realm Act. The writer acknowledges that a number of innocent people have been detained but adds that 'flamboyant and incendiary language' would hinder the peace which General Maxwell is trying to restore.</p>

Headquarters, Irish Command, Parkgate, Dublin.
14th May, 1916.
Sir,
I am directed by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief to inform you that his attention has been drawn to several articles that have appeared recently in your paper, the purpose of which appears to be to criticise and bring into contempt the administration of Martial Law in this country and to foster sympathy for those who have taken up arms, or plotted to do so, against His Majesty's Troops.
I am to inform you that the publication of such sentiments cannot be tolerated and that the appearance of any further articles of this nature in any newspaper under your control will render you liable to immediate action being taken under the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act.
The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief is well aware that the suppression of the rising inevitably entailed the regrettable arrest and detention of a certain number of persons who neither encouraged nor took part in the rebellion or in the preparations for same. These cases are being investigated with all possible dispatch and though some time may elapse before all the innocent persons can be liberated, Press comments dwelling upon and emphasising in flamboyant and incendiary language any such cases of hardship and injustice can but have a prejudicial effect upon the peace of the country which it is the object of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief  to restore as speedily as possible.
I have the honour to be,
Your obedient Servant
R.H.
Brigadier General, General Staff.
To The Editor, Freeman's Journal, Dublin.

<salute>Sir,</salute></opener>
<p>I am directed by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief
<lb/> to inform you that his attention has been drawn to severa
l<lb/> articles that have appeared recently in your paper, the purpose
<lb/> of which appears to be to criticise and bring into contempt the
<lb/> administration of Martial Law in this country and to foster
<lb/> sympathy for those who have taken up arms, or plotted
<lb/> to do so, against His Majesty's Troops.</p>
<p>I am to inform you that the publication of such
<lb/> sentiments cannot be tolerated and that the appearance of any
<lb/> further articles of this nature in any newspaper under your
<lb/> control will render you liable to immediate action being taken
<lb/> under the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act.</p>
<p>The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief is well aware
<lb/> that the suppression of the rising inevitably entailed the
<lb/> regrettable arrest and detention of a certain number of persons
<lb/> who neither encouraged nor took part in the rebellion or in
<lb/> the preparations for same. These cases are being investigated
<lb/> with all possible dispatch and though some time may elapse before
<lb/> all the innocent persons can be liberated, Press comments
<lb/> dwelling upon and emphasising in flamboyant and incendiary
<lb/> language any such cases of hardship and injustice can but have
<lb/> a prejudicial effect upon the peace of the country which it is
<lb/> the object of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief  to restore
<lb/> as speedily as possible.</p>
<closer><salute>I have the honour to be,
<lb/>Your obedient Servant</salute>
