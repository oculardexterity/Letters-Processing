                            <p>A letter from Helen A. Crofton (1843-1917) to Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) . In this letter Crofton is offering her services should postal censorship be established in Dublin. Crofton states that she has sufficient German to censor any letters written in the language and refers to her experience with genealogical work. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Birrell served as the chief secretary of Ireland from 1907 to 1916. Birrell was a liberal politician praised for his reforms of the Irish education system. The Easter Rising caught him unawares and, occupied in London, there was little he could do. A later inquiry into the Rising held Birrell chiefly responsible for the events that occurred leading to his resignation on 1 May 1916.</p>

            in the present crisis &#x2014;</p>

<p>I enclose a letter from
<lb/>the War Office in which you
<lb/>will see that (after having
<lb/>written fully and confidentially
<lb/>to several references ) they
<lb/>practically offered me a
<lb/>post in London, provided
<lb/>I knew sufficient German
<lb/>to censor letters written
<lb/>in that language &#x2014;  I had not 
<lb/>known that this was necessary,
<lb/>and though I have more than
<lb/>a slight knowledge of German
<lb/>feared to undertake the work
<pb/>
<lb/>and I did not care to go to
<lb/>Liverpool, another thing they suggested.</p>

<p>I also enclose confidential
<lb/>copy of the questions asked of
<lb/>my referees.</p>

<p>I am literary, and have
<lb/>also done a good deal of
<lb/>genealogical research work &#x2014;
<lb/>in some of which Sir <unclear>Arthur</unclear>
<lb/>Vicars and Mr. G. Burtcheal
<lb/>kindly gave me assistance.</p>
