                            <p>A letter from Peter Mooney (b.1886) to his sister, Katie (b.1884). Peter thanks Katie for the various items she sent to him, concluding that she is minding him very well. Peter writes the weather is beautiful, he could happily live in such conditions. He believes that he will be granted leave on the 23 of January and warns that when he comes back, he'll eat a 'terrible feed of eggs and rashers.'</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Orphaned at age 7, Peter and his sister Katie were raised by their uncle William and his wife Mary in Caulstown. While there are no surviving enlistment papers for Peter, his War Badge Index Record shows his enlistment date as 18 October 1915. He served with the Royal Artillery and later transferred to the Royal Engineers where he was promoted to the rank of Sergeant. He served in several places at the Western Front, including Ypres, St. Omer and Passchendael. Peter and Kate were avid correspondents. This letter part of a collection of over ninety surviving letters.</p>

            <p>we were out with the<lb/>
 teams every day this<lb/>
 week. I am doing well<lb/>
 at the business and<lb/>
 enjoy it well. I am<lb/>
 sure Billy &amp; the <unclear>Cockey</unclear><lb/>
 horse would cause<lb/>
 some row if they were<lb/>
 put in the teams.<lb/> 
I am very glad to see<lb/>
 you gave poor Charley<lb/>
 the pound he deserves<lb/>
 it. I will eat a terrible<lb/>
 feed of eggs &amp; rashers<lb/>
 when I get home.</p>

 out of old Dunnes way<lb/>
 when I get home he might<lb/>
 hit me with the meat<lb/>

<salute>Dear Katie,</salute></opener>
<p>I received all the<lb/>
 things you sent me alright<lb/>
 you are certainly minding<lb/>
 me very well. I think<lb/>
 we get leave on the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi><lb/>
 of the month. The weather<lb/>
 here is glorious it is<lb/>
 lovely out in the mornings<lb/>
 with all the birds<lb/>
 singing in the trees I<lb/>
 could live here for a lifetime</p>
