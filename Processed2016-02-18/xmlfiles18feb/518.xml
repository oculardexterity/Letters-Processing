                            <p>The letter is from E. Blackwell, under secretary of state for the Home Office to George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) and refers to the execution of Sir Roger Casement, who had been tried for treason having been arrested on the eve of the Easter Rising. Blackwell is responding to Gavan Duffy's request that Casement's body be bured outside of prison walls, the desire of Casement's family, and that he be allowed to be present at the execution, noting that the Secretary of State for the Home Office (Herbert Samuel) could not accede to the request.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>George Gavan Duffy was an Irish politician, barrister and judge. He unsuccessfully defended Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising.</p>
