                            <p>The letter is from writer, war correspondent and crusading journalist Henry W. Nevinson (1846-1951) to Gertrude Bannister (later Parry), a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). Nevinson writes to inform Bannister about individuals who have agreed to write personally to the British Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928) or sign petitions in support of Casement. The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. In the 1900s Nevinson had worked closely with Casement in raising awareness about slavery in western Africa and he worked extensively for the campaign to save Casement.</p>
