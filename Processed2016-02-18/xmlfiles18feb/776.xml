                            <p>Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928). Maxwell writes to advise Asquith on the Bishop of Cork, Dr. Daniel Cohalan, (1858-1952). Dr.Cohalan was later an outspoken critic during the Irish War of Independence, condemning acts of violence on both sides.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>The letter is a response to questions arising from the killing of Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878-1916), a pacifist. At the time of writing Maxwell doesn't know the identity of the military officer who was present at the arrest of Sheehy Skeffington but he makes a point to say that it was not Captain Bowen Colthurst (1880-1966). Maxwell says in this letter that, as far as he knows, the death of Sheehy Skeffington was not known at the time of the search. However, it is reported elsewhere that the search was ordered by Colthurst in an effort to find evidence against Sheehy Skeffington which might go towards justification of his actions.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>The letter also gives number of troops serving in Dublin and refers to an article in the nationalist newspaper, the 'Freeman's Journal'. As Asquith was due in Dublin on the date of the letter, it may have served as a briefing.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Herbert Henry Asquith was Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. Sir John Henry Grenfell Maxwell was appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising. Before 1916, Maxwell briefly held command of British troops in Egypt, where he successfully organised defences against a Turkish attack in February 1915 and presided over the huge expansion of his command as Egypt became a major British imperial military base. In March 1916, having been superseded as general officer commanding in Egypt, he was recalled home when the Easter Rising broke out.</p>

Dear Mr.Asquith,
The name of the Bishop of Cork is Dr.Daniel Cohalan.
Mr.F.Sheehy Skeffington's house in Dublin was searched on Friday the 28th April, in accordance with general instructions that the houses of suspects were to be searched for arms. Military assistance was given to the police for this purpose. It was not done by Capt Bowen Colthurst - I am enquiring as to what officer was present. As far as I know Mr.Sheehy Skeffington's death was not known at the time the search was made. I enclose a paper on this gentleman's antecedents.
The number of troops in Ireland irrespective of 59th Division is roughly
17000 Infantry
3149 Cavalry
1000 Artillery but these

<salute>Dear Mr.Asquith,</salute></opener>
<p>The name of the Bishop of Cork is D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
<lb/>Daniel Cohalan.</p>
<p>Mr.F.Sheehy Skeffington's house in Dublin
<lb/> was searched on Friday the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> April, in
<lb/> accordance with general instructions
<lb/> that the houses of suspects were to be searched
<lb/> for arms. Military assistance was given
<lb/> to the police for this purpose. It was not done
<lb/> by Capt Bowen Colthurst - I am enquiring
<lb/> as to what officer was present. As far as
<lb/> I know Mr.Sheehy Skeffington's death was
<lb/> not known of at the time the search was
<lb/> made. I enclose a paper on this gentleman'
s<lb/> antecedents.</p>
<p>The number of troops in Ireland irrespective
<lb/> of 59<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Division is roughly<lb/>
17000 Infantry<lb/>
3149 Cavalry<lb/>
1000 Artillery but these<lb/>

            <lb/>are all the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> line troops and draft
<lb/> finding units.</p>
<p>Will it be convenient for you to visit
<lb/> Richmond Barracks at 2.30 tomorrow
<lb/> and afterwards George V hospital as
<lb/> I find I have an inspection at 4p.m.
<lb/> at Trinity College, Dublin.</p>
