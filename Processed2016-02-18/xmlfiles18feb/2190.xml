                            <p>A letter from Seamus Fitzgerald (1896-1972) to his mother, Alice. Seamus writes that his new privileges allow him to write more often. Prisoners are allowed to walk and talk in pairs for nearly an hour "a blessing after such isolation". He requests a pencil and a stamped addressed envelope (to write home), as well as "about 1/2 lb butter every week, a large cake, home made preferable, twice a week, a piece of cooked bacon or pork, some hard sweets like bullseyes etc., and such like". He cautions no tins are allowed and requests the food as soon as possible. He would also like some volumes of Cassell's Educator to be sent on so he can use the time profitably, as well as his prayerbook and rosary beads. He closes the letter with a warning not to put letters in parcels and sends love to all at home.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Séamus Fitzgerald was an Irish business man and politician. Apprenticing at a dock yard, Fitzgerald joined the Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin after Easter week and was subsequently arrested and interned in Frongoch camp. He would enter politics upon his release.</p>

<lb/>Certain privileges just granted to us
<lb/>explains this, my second letter this week. We were 
<lb/>allowed talk and walk in pairs at exercise today for
<lb/>nearly an hour; a blessing after such isolation.
<lb/>We are allowed write home as after as we wish, provided
<lb/>we have stamped addressed envelopes, so I just want you to 
<lb/>send me some note-papers, envelopes &amp; about 12 stamps <add>&amp; a puce pencil.</add>
<lb/>I'm sure you will know what to send me, for instance 
<lb/>about 1/2 lb butter every week; a large cake, home-made
<lb/>preferably, twice a week; a piece of cooked bacon or<pb/>

<lb/>If you send these as soon as possible, Mother,
<lb/>it would please me greatly, for as you can 
<lb/>imagine, we don't get too much here.</p>
<p>I would also like you to send one or two 
<lb/>volumes of Cassell's Educator, so that I can 
<lb/>make some use of my time here, also my prayer
<lb/>book and rosary beads. I hope you sent the
<lb/>Bible, for I have got nothing yet from home. 
<lb/>As for the clothes and boots, I have already
<lb/>got a new suit and pair of boots from the
<lb/>authorities, who served them out to all those in 
<lb/>need of them, but if you have sent them, it
<lb/>doesn't matter as these ones are not as good 
<lb/>a fit, as my own, of course.</p>
<p>If the censor doesn't say otherwise here,
<lb/>you need not send the parcels thro' London; only 
<lb/>the letters need be sent thro' London, 
<lb/>and don't out letters in the parcels. Tell 
<lb/>Bob + Lil to write, and Patrick, as it is a joy 
<lb/>to get a letter. <unclear>Mind</unclear> you address them properly.</p>
<p>Again, hoping you won't forget <del>the</del> to send

<lb/>Certain privileges just granted to us

<lb/>allowed talk and walk in pairs at exercise today for
<lb/>nearly an hour; a blessing after such isolation.
<lb/>We are allowed write home as after as we wish, provided
<lb/>we have stamped addressed envelopes, so I just want you to 
<lb/>send me some note-papers, envelopes &amp; about 12 stamps <add>&amp; a puce pencil.</add>
<lb/>I'm sure you will know what to send me, for instance

<lb/>preferably, twice a week; a piece of cooked bacon or<pb/>

<salute>Dear Mother,</salute></opener>
<lb/>Certain privileges just granted to us
<lb/>explains this, my second letter this week. We were 
<lb/>allowed talk and walk in pairs at exercise today for
<lb/>nearly an hour; a blessing after such isolation.
<lb/>We are allowed write home as after as we wish, provided
<lb/>we have stamped addressed envelopes, so I just want you to 
<lb/>send me some note-papers, envelopes &amp; about 12 stamps <add>&amp; a puce pencil.</add>
<lb/>I'm sure you will know what to send me, for instance 
<lb/>about 1/2 lb butter every week; a large cake, home-made
<lb/>preferably, twice a week; a piece of cooked bacon or
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="5693" facs="#L1916_2190_img_5693"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>pork; some hard sweets like bullseyes; and such
<lb/> like; but tinned stuff of any sort are not allowed. 
<lb/>If you send these as soon as possible, Mother,
<lb/>it would please me greatly, for as you can 
<lb/>imagine, we don't get too much here.</p>
<p>I would also like you to send one or two 
<lb/>volumes of Cassell's Educator, so that I can 
<lb/>make some use of my time here, also my prayer
<lb/>book and rosary beads. I hope you sent the
<lb/>Bible, for I have got nothing yet from home. 
<lb/>As for the clothes and boots, I have already
<lb/>got a new suit and pair of boots from the
<lb/>authorities, who served them out to all those in 
<lb/>need of them, but if you have sent them, it
<lb/>doesn't matter as these ones are not as good 
<lb/>a fit, as my own, of course.</p>
<p>If the censor doesn't say otherwise here,
<lb/>you need not send the parcels thro' London; only 
<lb/>the letters need be sent thro' London, 
<lb/>and don't out letters in the parcels. Tell 
<lb/>Bob &amp; Lil to write, and Patrick, as it is a joy 
<lb/>to get a letter. <unclear>Mind</unclear> you address them properly.</p>
<p>Again, hoping you won't forget <del>the</del> to send
<lb/>the parcels immediately, I will say goodbye,<lb/> 
<lb/>with love to all at home, Lil, <unclear>me,</unclear>Bob &amp; rest,
<lb/>hoping and trusting God will soon bring home,
<lb/>safe, to you, your </p>

<note>P.S. Hope Tom &amp; Michael &amp; Eddie    
<lb/>Pray for me. Jim.</note>
