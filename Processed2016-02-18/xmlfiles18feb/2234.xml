                            <p>A letter John Lynn to George Hackney (1889-1977). In the letter, Lynn hopes that George is recovering speedily from the shell-shock he suffered in the trenches. He hopes that George will be able to visit home soon 'for a while', and mentions a recent visit to George by a mutual acquaintance, a Reverend Sam McKenzie. He says that all the staff in the Depot wish George the best. He refers also to the health of George's mother, stating she is 'very much as usual'.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is from the papers of George Naphthali Hackney , a  Lance Corporal from Clifton, Belfast. Before his time in the army, he worked as a book-keeper for a florist. He was the youngest in a Presbyterian family of six, with three older sisters. In 2014, his collection of photographs taken in the trenches were made available to the public in an Ulster Museum exhibition, and his life and photography became the subject of a BBC documentary, 'The Man who Shot the Great War'. In 1916 he was injured and spent some time in Wharncliffe War Hospital, Sheffield. The author of the letter, John Lynn, was the manager of the Bible and Book Depot of The Sabbath School Society for Ireland, a Presbyterian Sunday School. The Depot was an Agency for Colportage, i.e. the distribution of religious texts.</p>

<salute>My dear George,</salute>

<p>A few days ago I heard that you had got the length 
<lb/>of Sheffield, and that you are now in hospital suffering from shell-
<lb/>shock.</p>

<p>The last communication of yours that I saw was one
<lb/> you had written to Mr. Russell, and I think you were then in France.</p>

<p>I hope, now that you  have got back to Blighty, your
<lb/> health is improving, and I don't suppose you have any objections to
<lb/> being a little nearer your native land.  As a result of your trying 
<lb/>experiences, I hope you will not be permanently injured.</p>

<p>When you get well enough I suppose you will be allowed
<lb/> home for a while.  We should all like very much to see you on your
<lb/> return.</p>

<p>I wrote the Rev. Sam McKenzie when I heard you were in
<lb/> a Sheffield hospital.  You will, no doubt, remember him.  I think he
<lb/> was a student when you were here.  He is a native of Bangor.  I had
<lb/> a post-card from him saying he had called on you.  I suppose a visit
<lb/> from <del>every</del> anyone whom you know is acceptable at any time.</p>

<p>All the staff here were sorry to know that you were
<lb/> unwell, but we all hope you will soon be quite fit and able to got about
<lb/> as usual.</p>

<salute>My dear George,</salute></opener>

<p>A few days ago I heard that you had got the length 
<lb/>of Sheffield, and that you are now in hospital suffering from shell-
<lb/>shock.</p>

<p>The last communication of yours that I saw was one
<lb/> you had written to Mr. Russell, and I think you were then in France.</p>

<p>I hope, now that you  have got back to Blighty, your
<lb/> health is improving, and I don't suppose you have any objections to
<lb/> being a little nearer your native land.  As a result of your trying 
<lb/>experiences, I hope you will not be permanently injured.</p>

<p>When you get well enough I suppose you will be allowed
<lb/> home for a while.  We should all like very much to see you on your
<lb/> return.</p>

<p>I wrote the Rev. Sam McKenzie when I heard you were in
<lb/> a Sheffield hospital.  You will, no doubt, remember him.  I think he
<lb/> was a student when you were here.  He is a native of Bangor.  I had
<lb/> a post-card from him saying he had called on you.  I suppose a visit
<lb/> from <del>every</del> anyone whom you know is acceptable at any time.</p>
