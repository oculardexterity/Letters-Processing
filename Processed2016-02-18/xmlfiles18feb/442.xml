                            <p>The letter is from Fred Allan (1861-1937), a member of the Irish National Aid Association.  The letter refers to the printing of a pamphlet of songs about the Rising. The pamphlets would be sold to raise funds and a garden fete and performance of the songs is also mentioned. The Stanley mentioned is Joseph Michael Stanley, a printer.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>The association was founded after the Rising to provide relief to the dependents of those who were executed, killed in the fighting or had lost their employment. It later merged with the Irish Volunteer Dependents' Fund to form the Irish National Aid and Volunteer Dependents' Fund. Frederick James Allen was an Irish Nationalist and republican. During the Parnell era, Allan was one of the most influential and powerful men in the IRB. He later resigned from the organisation in 1912. Allan opposed the 1916 Rising, viewing it as a futile gesture, yet he would go on to be heavily involved in the politics of the Irish War of Independence.</p>
