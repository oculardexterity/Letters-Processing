                            <p>A letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his mother, Clara Mary. Davidson describes what he has been doing since his previous letter and thanks her for the fruit and other supplies she sent. He also writes about the boots she sent, for though they were what he asked for, there were not any nails in the soles.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>My boots &amp; leggings came a few days ago &amp; <lb/> I would like you to tell Manfield that the<lb/> boots were exactly right except that there<lb/> were no nails in the soles, so when I want<lb/> another pair they will know exactly what<lb/> to make.

The fruit arrived in splendid<lb/> condition &amp; will last quite a long time as<lb/> the box was as big as the last one. As regards<lb/> the parcel from Malcomsons you might<lb/> please tell them not to send any coffee as<lb/> I never use it. There is always plenty<lb/> of tea &amp; we prefer it.

<p><salute>My dearest Mother</salute>&#x2014; I have not been
<lb/> able to write you since last Sunday as
<lb/> I have had such a busy week of it &amp; hope
<lb/> you wont imagine that we have started
<lb/> again for the trenches. Fortunately we
<lb/> are now likely to remain where we are
<lb/> for a few weeks &amp; so will be able to spend
<lb/> quite a merry Xmas. The move that was
<lb/> anticipated has evidently been cancelled
<lb/> for the time being, &amp; naturally everyone is
<lb/> delighted, as we are in such comfortable
<lb/> quarters. My machine gun training work
<lb/> is again in full swing &amp; I dont have much
<lb/> time to spare as even when the outdoor
<lb/> part is finished there are always office matters
<lb/> to be attended to. We all like our new
<lb/> Brigadier very much &#x2014; he seems very
<lb/> capable &amp; is a man who knows his
<lb/> own mind &amp; has very definite ideas.

<p><salute>My dearest Mother</salute>&#x2014; I have not been
<lb/> able to write you since last Sunday as
<lb/> I have had such a busy week of it &amp; hope
<lb/> you wont imagine that we have started
<lb/> again for the trenches. Fortunately we
<lb/> are now likely to remain where we are
<lb/> for a few weeks &amp; so will be able to spend
<lb/> quite a merry Xmas. The move that was
<lb/> anticipated has evidently been cancelled
<lb/> for the time being, &amp; naturally everyone is
<lb/> delighted, as we are in such comfortable
<lb/> quarters. My machine gun training work
<lb/> is again in full swing &amp; I dont have much
<lb/> time to spare as even when the outdoor
<lb/> part is finished there are always office matters
<lb/> to be attended to. We all like our new
<lb/> Brigadier very much &#x2014; he seems very
<lb/> capable &amp; is a man who knows his
<lb/> own mind &amp; has very definite ideas.

            <p>Weather still awfully wet - it seems
<lb/> ages since we had a nice bright day
<lb/>I suppose it is much the same at home.
<lb/>My boots &amp; leggings came a few days ago &amp; 
<lb/> I would like you to tell Manfield that the
<lb/> boots were exactly right except that there
<lb/> were no nails in the soles, so when I want
<lb/> another pair they will know exactly what
<lb/> to make. You need not order any for
<lb/> the present as I wont require another pair
<lb/> for some time &amp; besides I have still the
<lb/> pair of <unclear>hop</unclear> boots at home. The parcel
<lb/> from Malcomsons also came &amp; today
<lb/> the box of fruit. Thanks so much dear
<lb/> Mother for all. The fruit arrived in splendid
<lb/> condition &amp; will last quite a long time as
<lb/> the box was as big as the last one. As regards
<lb/> the parcel from Malcomsons you might
<lb/> please tell them not to send any coffee as
<lb/> I never use it. There is always plenty
<lb/> of tea &amp; we prefer it. The butter &amp; cake
        
    
         
        <pb n="5608" facs="#L1916_2172_img_5608"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>were greatly appreciated. Have had
<lb/> your letters of 10<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> &amp; 13<hi rend="superscript"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi>, the latter written
<lb/>just after you had received my short note
<lb/> however you would have since have got my later
<lb/> letters &amp; be relieved to know that we really
<lb/> had not moved. The kit bag <sic>as</sic> not arrived
<lb/> so far but no doubt will turn up in a day
<lb/> or two. Now dear Mother I must close
<lb/> up for it is almost midnight. Will probably
<lb/> write again before Xmas but if not I send
<lb/> my best wishes to all &amp; with fondest love.</p>
