                            <p>Letter from Mr Henry A. Johnston SJ (1888-1986) to his Irish Jesuit Provincial, Fr Thomas V Nolan SJ (1867-1941), in which he announces that he has received a 'very mysterious' letter from Mr Finn. Mr Finn wants you to know  'that he and his two fellow exiles are in good health and the troubles of the hour are not weighing too heavily on them'. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>From 1914 until 1918, Irish Jesuits Timothy Halpin (1879-1951), Daniel Finn (1886-1936) and John Coyne (1889-1978) were unable to leave Austria due to the First World War. It is presumed that they spent their time at Jesuit houses in Innsbruck. In those four years, there was very little communication with Ireland to give an account of their lives.</p>

<salute>Dear Fr. Provincial,</salute>
<lb/>P.C.
<p>I had a letter
<lb/> from Mr. Finn yesterday. It was a
<lb/> very mysterious one, and owing to
<lb/> suppression of names and other precautions,
<lb/> it was not clear for whom it was
<lb/> meant. It passed through several
<lb/> hands before reaching me, and I
<lb/> recognised it as an answer to a
<lb/> note I had sent him at
<lb/> Christmas, which he got. He
<lb/> wants you to know that he
<lb/> and his two fellow-exiles are in
<lb/> good health and the troubles of
<lb/> the hour are not weighing too
