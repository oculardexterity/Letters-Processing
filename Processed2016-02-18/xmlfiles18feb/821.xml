                            <p>This telegraph was sent by a number of prominent Cork citizens to Sir Ivor Churchill Guest (1873-1939), 1st Viscount Wimborne, lord lieutenant of Ireland.  The authors believe their message voices the opinion of the 'vast majority of Citizens of Cork'. It requests an end to the executions and mass arrests that followed the suppression of the Easter Rising. It is argued that to continue would have a 'most serious affect on the people' and be 'extremely prejudicial to the peace'. The letter came on the day that Thomas Kent was executed in Cork Detention Barracks for his part in the death of a policeman.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>The signatories to the message include Rev. Daniel Cohalan, later bishop of Cork and an outspoken opponent of IRA violence during the War of Independence, the lord mayor of Cork, the high sheriff of Cork and members of the United Irish League. Lord Wimborne was appointed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1915. Guest worked closely alongside Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939) in the administration of Ireland. Following the suppression of the Rising, Guest, under pressure, was forced to resign as Lord Lieutenant. A later inquiry into the Rising exonerated Guest and held Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) chiefly responsible for the events that occurred. Guest would continue to serve as Lord Lieutenant until 1918.</p>

<lb/>the great majority of the Citizens of
<lb/> Cork, we desire to protest most 
<lb/>strongly against any further shooting 
<lb/>as the result of Court Martial trials,
<lb/> and against the indiscriminate

<lb/> feelings of the people, and may be

<lb/>friendly relations between the Irish
<lb/> and English people.</p>
