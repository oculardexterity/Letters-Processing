                            <p>A letter from W. Goodman to Mabel Fitzgerald (1884-1957). Mabel FitzGerald's husband Desmond FitzGerald, (1888-1947) had been arrested and detained at Richmond Barracks to await Court-Martial. W. Goodman writes that he was also arrested and had been put in a cell with Mr. FitzGerald. The latter asked him to write to Mabel to tell her how he was doing. Goodman reports that FitzGerald was in very good form - singing and sleeping well. They also discussed religion and politics and Goodman expresses great admiration for FitzGerald who he hopes will get out soon. He writes that he expects Fitzgerald will achieve a high position in life.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p> Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

To Mrs T Desmond Fitzgerald

Dear Madam
Your husband Mr.Desmond Fitzgerald asked me when I saw him yesterday to tell you how he was getting on.
I was arrested for not having a Pass at Kingstown on Wednesday morning last & was placed in a cell with Mr.Fitzgerald & spent 28 hours with him. He was very olly & in the best of heart & sang about 20 songs & slept grand.
I differ with him in Religion and Politics but I couldn't help being extremely fond of him.
I was very sorry indeed to leave him in such surroundings but I presume if not soon liberated he will be shifted to better quarters.
I do hope he will get free & if so I shall expect to hear of him occupying a high position in
