<salute>My dearest Sophy,</salute>
<p>This is a day of quiet so I 
<lb/>must take advantage of it to write
<lb/>to you. I am afraid that you 
<lb/>will feel the sudden change to 
<lb/>cold that we had last night.</p>
<p>Albert is I think, better, he
<lb/>has more intervals of comfort
<lb/>but cannot get to bed before
<lb/>about 2 o'clock. Last night at that
<lb/>hour he had a wretchedly bad
<lb/>attack &amp; was induced to inhale
<lb/>an "<unclear>arugl</unclear>" capsule which he likes 
<lb/>to keep as a refuge when he is
<lb/>really bad. It relieved him won&#x2014;
<lb/>derfully &amp; he had the best 
<lb/>night he has had for some 
<lb/>weeks. a "delightful sleep". We
<lb/>had a long letter from Charlie
<lb/>yesterday as far as we can make 
<lb/>out he had one nights sleep in
<lb/>a weeks. Then he was tramping

<opener><salute>My dearest Sophy,</salute></opener>
<p>This is a day of quiet so I 
<lb/>must take advantage of it to write
<lb/>to you. I am afraid that you 
<lb/>will feel the sudden change to 
<lb/>cold that we had last night.</p>
<p>Albert is I think, better, he
<lb/>has more intervals of comfort
<lb/>but cannot get to bed before
<lb/>about 2 o'clock. Last night at that
<lb/>hour he had a wretchedly bad
<lb/>attack &amp; was induced to inhale
<lb/>an "<unclear>arugl</unclear>" capsule which he likes 
<lb/>to keep as a refuge when he is
<lb/>really bad. It relieved him won&#x2014;
<lb/>derfully &amp; he had the best 
<lb/>night he has had for some 
<lb/>weeks. a "delightful sleep". We
<lb/>had a long letter from Charlie
<lb/>yesterday as far as we can make 
<lb/>out he had one nights sleep in
<lb/>a weeks. Then he was tramping
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="682" facs="#L1916_261_img_682"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>2. 
<lb/> all day &amp; dead tired &amp; sleepy 
<lb/> at 9 so he went to bed, there 
<lb/> was  call up at 10. to <unclear>waken</unclear> 
<lb/> night duty at the  battery every 
<lb/> time he sat down he felt he 
<lb/> was dropping off to sleep so 
<lb/> walked about till 9 o'clock the 
<lb/> next morning ( I forgot to say that 
<lb/> the day before he did the 
<lb/> 30 miles tramp through trenches 
<lb/> half had no supper the evening 
<lb/> before &amp; no breakfast that 
<lb/> morning!) Then the Captain 
<lb/> came up &amp; while C. was waiting 
<lb/> to be relieved he was talking 
<lb/> to him when suddenly every &#x2014;
<lb/> thing went round. &amp; the next 
<lb/> thing he knew he was on 
<lb/> a stretcher he has no idea 
<lb/> how he fainted, They 
<lb/> took him off for a long way 
<lb/> in a Med X van to hospital
        
    
         
        <pb n="683" facs="#L1916_261_img_683"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>3. 
<lb/> he was so dead tired he 
<lb/> slept all the way &amp; is very 
<lb/> indignant with the Capt for 
<lb/> sending him to hospital but 
<lb/> I think it was the one sensible 
<lb/> thing in the whole show 
<lb/> it really is irrational to use 
<lb/> up men in such a way &#x2014;</p> 
<p>On one day I was left in 
<lb/> charge of a live battery 
<lb/> ( he had never seen the guns 
<lb/> before) &amp; orders came to fire 
<lb/> on an enemy tramway
<lb/> but after 5 rounds the mist 
<lb/> came down so that the ob&#x2014;
<lb/>server could not see &amp; they had 
<lb/> to stop to C's great sorrow 
<lb/> They seem to have been 
<lb/> moved backwards &amp; for&#x2014; 
<lb/> wards in the apparently
        
    
         
        <pb n="684" facs="#L1916_261_img_684"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>4
<lb/>aimless way that they are 
<lb/> walked about &amp; as C expresses 
<lb/> it they "scavenged" 3 positions 
<lb/> for their battery &amp; were 
<lb/> not allowed to occupy any 
<lb/> of them. I am sure the 
<lb/> work was very arduous 
<lb/> &amp; the whole thing an en&#x2014; 
<lb/> acting experience to the 
<lb/> boy which no doubt added to 
<lb/> the complete exhaustion 
<lb/> helped to finish him, he 
<lb/> wrote from hospital. up 
<lb/> &amp; dressed on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the day 
<lb/>after he was brought there 
<lb/> &amp; was very comfortable 
<lb/> &amp; they were going to have 
<lb/> a concert that evening 
<lb/> &amp; he said he was "right 
<lb/> as rain " &amp; hoped to be sent

            <lb/>5 
<lb/>back next day he was only 
<lb/> concerned at being taken a&#x2014; 
<lb/> way from his battery. He 
<lb/> has been laying his telephone 
<lb/> lines. He says their present 
<lb/> position is quite a good one 
<lb/> &amp; they have billets in the one 
<lb/> house left standing &amp; there 
<lb/>  is a grand work = sleep, they 
<lb/>are making a splendid "ob&#x2014;
<lb/> servation park" &amp; he hopes they 
<lb/> may be left there to use it 
<lb/> but it is doubtful whether 
<lb/> they will not be moved on 
<lb/> I know you like to hear 
<lb/>of him, so have sent you 
<lb/>all the particulars. poor 
<lb/> <unclear>miss</unclear> Baird is weather bound 
<lb/> here by these awful gales 
<lb/> She is dangerously seasick 
<lb/> &amp; it is sad if she is to lose the

<lb/>good of her holiday by a bad 
<lb/> crossing we have quite lost 
<lb/> our hearts to her. I think she 
<lb/> is really happy at finding her&#x2014;
<lb/> self in a home once more 
<lb/> She has been over here for five 
<lb/> years away from her family 
<lb/> &amp; is often homesick &#x2014; There 
<lb/> was a wire from May this 
<lb/> morning to say that Jack
<lb/> had arrived yesterday, &amp; they 
<lb/> might perhaps read this 
<lb/>  tomorrow afternoon. Will 
<lb/> you dear S. send this on to 
<lb/> Corris as it takes a long time 
<lb/> to give Charlie's news &amp; it will 
<lb/> save me writing it out again 
<lb/> We are much looking forward 
<lb/> to having Jack &amp; May with 
<lb/> us for a bit. The wind has been 
<lb/> so wild that the trees are nearly 
<lb/> leafless before they have turned</p>
