<p> Under any conditions, the families of those who were killed or taken captive would be

<lb/>all that sorely afflicted populace.</p>
<p>To relieve the families of those massacred and slain, as well as of those who are actually
<lb/>starving or in danger of starvation, a fund is being raised, and this Committee appeals to 
<lb/>the whole body of the American people for contributions to aid this object, which is purely

<p>In the language of the Committee in Ireland, " we make our appeal to all human hearts,
<lb/>whose noble compassion can reach over every obstacle to redress wrongs and alleviate suffering,
<lb/>that they may co-operate in this merciful and righteous work, For the sake of our country we
<lb/>make it, of our Nation's honor, and of our own, so that its high repute for justice shall be
<lb/>transmitted by our generation unsullied to future and happier times."</p>

<lb/>TO THE CHARITABLE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
<p>The terrible scourge of war, which has devastated so many countries of Europe, has fallen
<lb/>with fury upon Ireland, At the present moment the Irish Capitol and other cities and 
<lb/>towns are largely in ruins. In the language of a Relief Committee, headed by Reverend
<lb/>Richard Bowden, Administrator of the Dublin Pro-Cathedral,   "300 were slain during the insurrection,
<lb/>15 were executed by Courts-martial, 134 have been condemned to penal servitude, 2650
<lb/>were deported without trial, and 400 await sentence by Courts-martial." </p>
<p>All these calamities have produced a suspension of industry and reduced to idleness 
<lb/>practically the entire labouring population of Dublin and other places.</p>
<p> Under any conditions, the families of those who were killed or taken captive would be
<lb/>reduced to misery. But owning to the cessation of industry those who might be expected to relieve
<lb/>them are themselves rendered destitute and this distress, growing every hour more acute,
<lb/>must end, unless some relief be afforded, in total starvation of may and grievous suffering by
<lb/>all that sorely afflicted populace.</p>
<p>To relieve the families of those massacred and slain, as well as of those who are actually
<lb/>starving or in danger of starvation, a fund is being raised, and this Committee appeals to 
<lb/>the whole body of the American people for contributions to aid this object, which is purely
<lb/>humanitarian and charitable.</p>
<p>In the language of the Committee in Ireland, " we make our appeal to all human hearts,
<lb/>whose noble compassion can reach over every obstacle to redress wrongs and alleviate suffering,
<lb/>that they may co-operate in this merciful and righteous work, For the sake of our country we
<lb/>make it, of our Nation's honor, and of our own, so that its high repute for justice shall be
<lb/>transmitted by our generation unsullied to future and happier times."</p>
