                            <p>A letter from Ella Young (1867â€“1956) to Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929).  In this letter, written on 6 August 1916, Young reports on the collection of signatures for the reprieve of Roger Casement, who was hanged for treason on 3 August, as well as the local reaction to his death.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Young was a poet, republican, and mystic actively involved in the Celtic Revival. Alice Stopford Green was an Irish historian and nationalist. While not a supporter of armed rebellion, her house provided a space for leading nationalists to meet. Stopford Green had collaborated with Roger Casement on Congo Reform and, after the Easter Rising in 1916, she tried to save him from execution.</p>

6th August, 1916.

Dear Mrs. Green,

Colonel [?] has asked me to give you particulars of the petitions which a group of people working from this College originated. I am enclosing a list but think that it does not represent the total sent in, as in each case the people to whom forms were sent were asked to enlist their friends in these districts and some of them did so. Mr. Claud Cherasse wrote out a form of petition in Gaelic which he sent to some friends in Gaelic districts. I think it highly probably that in each place these petitions were signed and forwarded, but only in two instanced did the people concerned write to say they had forwarded the petitions. Mr. Claud Cherasse...

We ere grately hampered in our work by the shortness of time and by the fact that all news reched us a day late. We had only two typewriters and Miss Nelly O'Brien and Miss Noreen [?] had and work very hard. There is not a district in Ireland that would not have sent peotitions - these people only needed the told what to do and wher to send the peitions but I am afraid many districts did not even know till too late that petitions could be sent. Letters on the subject were not allowed in the [?] papers till near the end. We got many letters as possible into local papers but many of them are only published weekly.

<salute>Dear Mrs. Green,</salute>

<p>Colonel Moore has asked
<lb/> me to give you particulars of the
<lb/> petitions which a group of people
<lb/> working from this College originated.
<lb/> I am enclosing a list but
<lb/> think that it does not represent
<lb/> the total sent in, as in each
<lb/> case the people to whom forms
<lb/> were sent were asked to enlist
<lb/> their friends in these districts
<lb/> and some of them did so.
<lb/> Mr. Claud Chevasse wrote out a
<lb/> form of petition in Gaelic which
<lb/> he sent to some friends in
<lb/> Gaelic districts. I think it highly
<lb/> probable that in each place these
<lb/> petitions were signed &amp; forwarded,
<lb/> but only in two instances did
<lb/> the people concerned write to
<lb/> say they had forwarded the
<lb/> petitions. Mr. Claud Chevasse

<p>Mr. L. Mac Eochadda got many copies

<lb/> through friends in various places.
<lb/> He thinks that more than nine
<lb/> were sent in &amp; I have asked
<lb/> him to provide particulars as

<p>Among those who worked very

<lb/> Miss Mac Mahon of this College.
<lb/> He instructed the people in each
<lb/> case to send the petitions directly
<lb/> to Mr Asquith so cannot estimate
<lb/> the number of names signed.
<lb/> I heard that a great number of
<lb/> names were attached to the Galway 
<lb/>&amp; <unclear>Carlow</unclear> petitions &amp; Father
<lb/> Creghan of <unclear>Grange</unclear> told me

<p>We were greatly hampered
<lb/> in our work by the shortness of time
<lb/> &amp; by the fact that all news reached
<lb/> us a day late. We had only two
<lb/> typewriters and Miss Nellie O'Brien
<lb/>&amp; Miss Noreen Fox had to work
<lb/> very hard. There is not a district
<lb/> in Ireland that would not have sent
<lb/> petitions. These people only needed
<lb/> to be told what to do &amp; where
<lb/> to send the petitions, but I am
<lb/> afraid many districts did not
<lb/> even know till too late that
<lb/> petitions could be sent. Letters
<lb/> on the subject were not allowed
<lb/> in the <unclear>Dublin</unclear> papers till near
<lb/> the end. We got as many letters
<lb/> as possible into local papers
<lb/> but many of them are only published weekly.</p>
<p>Mass was said on
<lb/> <del>Thursday</del> Wednesday for the life
<lb/> of Mr. Roger Casement &amp; you

<salute>Dear Mrs. Green,</salute></opener>

<p>Colonel Moore has asked
<lb/> me to give you particulars of the
<lb/> petitions which a group of people
<lb/> working from this College originated.
<lb/> I am enclosing a list but
<lb/> think that it does not represent
<lb/> the total sent in, as in each
<lb/> case the people to whom forms
<lb/> were sent were asked to enlist
<lb/> their friends in these districts
<lb/> and some of them did so.
<lb/> Mr. Claud Chevasse wrote out a
<lb/> form of petition in Gaelic which
<lb/> he sent to some friends in
<lb/> Gaelic districts. I think it highly
<lb/> probable that in each place these
<lb/> petitions were signed &amp; forwarded,
<lb/> but only in two instances did
<lb/> the people concerned write to
<lb/> say they had forwarded the
<lb/> petitions. Mr. Claud Chevasse
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="1444" facs="#L1916_522_img_1444"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>has left the college, but if you
<lb/> write to him at Temple HIll Terenure
<lb/> Dublin, he may be able to procure 
<lb/> definite information as to the work
<lb/> done in each place. <del>Mr L. Mac</del></p>
<p>Mr. L. Mac Eochadda got many copies
<lb/> typed and procured nine petitions
<lb/> through friends in various places.
<lb/> He thinks that more than nine
<lb/> were sent in &amp; I have asked
<lb/> him to provide particulars as
<lb/> to these &amp; let you know.</p>
<p>Among those who worked very
<lb/> hard were Mr. Francis Ormsby,
<lb/> Ranelagh Schools Althlone &amp;
<lb/> Miss Mac Mahon of this College.
<lb/> He instructed the people in each
<lb/> case to send the petitions directly
<lb/> to Mr Asquith so cannot estimate
<lb/> the number of names signed.
<lb/> I heard that a great number of
<lb/> names were attached to the Galway 
<lb/>&amp; <unclear>Carlow</unclear> petitions &amp; Father
<lb/> Creghan of <unclear>Grange</unclear> told me
<lb/> he had got all the best
<lb/> names in Sligo.  The
<lb/> Carrigaholt petition has
<lb/> I think between 70 &amp; 100 names
        
    
         
        <pb n="1445" facs="#L1916_522_img_1445"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>was signed by all the local people
<lb/> of importance.</p>
<p>We were greatly hampered
<lb/> in our work by the shortness of time
<lb/> &amp; by the fact that all news reached
<lb/> us a day late. We had only two
<lb/> typewriters and Miss Nellie O'Brien
<lb/>&amp; Miss Noreen Fox had to work
<lb/> very hard. There is not a district
<lb/> in Ireland that would not have sent
<lb/> petitions. These people only needed
<lb/> to be told what to do &amp; where
<lb/> to send the petitions, but I am
<lb/> afraid many districts did not
<lb/> even know till too late that
<lb/> petitions could be sent. Letters
<lb/> on the subject were not allowed
<lb/> in the <unclear>Dublin</unclear> papers till near
<lb/> the end. We got as many letters
<lb/> as possible into local papers
<lb/> but many of them are only published weekly.</p>
<p>Mass was said on
<lb/> <del>Thursday</del> Wednesday for the life
<lb/> of Mr. Roger Casement &amp; you
        
    
         
        <pb n="1446" facs="#L1916_522_img_1446"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>on Friday. We would have had Mass on
<lb/> Thursday but did not know the
<lb/> reprieve had been refused. News only
<lb/> reached us in answer to wire in
<lb/> the afternoon. Everyone here was
<lb/> filled with rage &amp; grief &amp; we
<lb/> all hope that means will be
<lb/> taken  to let people all over
<lb/> the world &amp; especially in
<lb/> America know the brutal
<lb/> details of this latest example
<lb/> of English rule in Ireland.</p>
<p>Nothing could illustrate better
<lb/> than the fate of Sir Roger Casements
<lb/> and Sir &#x2014;Pyle. Mr. Pyle was a
<lb/> fishmonger who grew rich enough
<lb/> to get himself voted into the Lord
<lb/> Mayorship of Dublin as a
<lb/> strong nationalist. At the right
<lb/> moment when Queen Victoria paid
<lb/> a visit to this country he
<lb/> turned traitor to his party and
<lb/> was made a baronet as a reward
<lb/> for proposing the address of welcome<lb/>

<lb/> I know too that petitions were forwarded from<lb/>

<lb/>Ui Neill
<lb/>would tell you.</p>
