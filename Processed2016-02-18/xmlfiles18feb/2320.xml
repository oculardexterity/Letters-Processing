                            <p>Letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968). In this letter Spender expresses his longing to receive a letter from Lillian. He briefly mentions his current workload and advises Lillian to 'read between the lines' of his letters.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<lb/>No letter for 3 days or 4 now
<lb/>poor bw. but he knows
<lb/>you have written &amp; hopes
<lb/>for a big haul tonight.</p>
<p>Today <unclear>blimp finding</unclear> &amp; my 
<lb/>eyes a bit tired I won't
<lb/>write just now but hope
<lb/>to do so properly later.</p>
<p> I have quite a lot of work
<lb/>in hand just as much
<lb/>as I can do and it is 
<lb/>not made easier by 
<lb/>having 4 different masters
<lb/>- not to mention the BP &amp;

            <lb/>others at home - so that
<lb/>whilst I say to much
<lb/>for one man's likes, I may
<lb/>reach too little for the 
<lb/>other. 
<p>You must read
<lb/>between the lines for tho'
<lb/>nothing untrue is willingly
<lb/><unclear>suspected</unclear> the lights thrown
<lb/>on difficult subjects vary
<lb/>very particularly.</p>
<p> I had a very difficult job
<lb/>in getting <unclear>Myridge</unclear>, then sec 
<lb/>to the CGS, to hand over his 
<lb/>job of the dispatches to myself
<lb/>after he had already written
<lb/>it.</p>
