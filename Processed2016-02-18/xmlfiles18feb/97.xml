                            <p>Letter from a prisoner of war, Corporal W. Bowes, Connaught Rangers, to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Bowes was incarcerated in a camp in Osterrade, Germany at the time. In the letter, Bowes thanks Lady Clonbrock for parcels she had been sending him, writing that 'My kind lady could not be much better or sweeter to me.' He also offers to find out the whereabouts of another prisoner as he had changed camps.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (n√©e Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

August 13th 1916 - Captain W. Bowes Comm. Rangers

My Dear Kind Lady,

I am very pleased to acknowledge that last week I received one parcel containing boots, socks, slippers, shirt and drawers which I feel very pleased and thankful to get the contents of the parcels sent by you from the Irish Women's Association. My kind lady could not be much better or sweeter to me. 

I do not know where 75.5.5. Flanigan is, but I will do my best to find out. My address has been changed again, to the address on the envelope. I  am very pleased to know that the weather is keeping so fine at home. We are having very hot weather here lately. Well I will close this time my kind lady and feel very thankful to you. 

Yours respectfully.

<salute>My Dear Kind Lady,</salute></opener>

<p>I am very pleased to acknowledge that 
<lb/>last week I received one parcel containing 
<lb/>boots, socks, slippers, shirt and drawers which 
<lb/>I feel very pleased and thankful to get 
<lb/>the contents of the parcels sent by you from 
<lb/>the Irish Women's Association. My kind lady 
<lb/>could not be much better or sweeter to me. 
<lb/>I do not know where 75.5.5. Flanigan is but I 
<lb/>will do my best to find out. My address 
<lb/>has been changed again, to the address on 
<lb/>the envelope. I am very pleased to know 
<lb/>that the weather is keeping so fine at home. 
<lb/>We are <add>having</add> very hot <sic>wether</sic> here lately. 
<lb/>Well I will close this time my kind lady 
<lb/>and feel very thankful to you.</p> 
<closer><salute>Yours respectfully.</salute></closer>
