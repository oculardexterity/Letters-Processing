                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968). In this incomplete letter, Spender briefly discusses a mutual friend 'Ivy', despairs at the slow speed at which his work is progressing, and tells Lillian there is no hope that she will be allowed to join him at Headquarters, given the complete lack of women there currently. He discusses the wildlife in his locality and alludes to a possible future trip the couple will make to Japan. Spender also confesses that he has not written a letter to 'his folks' in a long time, as they are 'so difficult sometimes' to write to.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>
