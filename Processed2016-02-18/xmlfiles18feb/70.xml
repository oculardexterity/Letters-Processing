Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

Madam,
At the request of the Director General of Voluntary Organisations this sub-depot which controls the Sphagnum branch of the Irish War Hospital Supply Depot, <gap/> Merrion Square, has undertaken for the War Office the Sphagnum Supply for Ireland. The Director General has suggested that in connection with this depot two main centres should be formed in the country for the collection and preparation of the moss, so that it may be sent to Dublin ready to be made up into surgical dressings.

<salute>Madam,</salute></opener>
<p>At the request of the Director General 
<lb/>of Voluntary Organisations this sub-depot 
<lb/> which controls the Sphagnum branch of 
<lb/> the Irish War Hospital Supply Depot, 
<lb/> 40 Merrion Square, has undertaken for 
<lb/> the War Office the Sphagnum Supply
<lb/>  for Ireland. The Director General has 
<lb/> suggested that in connection with 
<lb/> this depot two main centres should be 
<lb/> formed in the country for the collection 
<lb/> and preparation of the moss, so that 
<lb/> it may be sent to Dublin ready to be 
<lb/> made up into surgical dressings.</p>
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="327" facs="#L1916_70_img_327"/>
        
        
           
            <p>Would it be possible for your Committee to 
<lb/> organise such a centre, as there are large 
<lb/> supplies of the moss available in CO. Galway. 
<lb/>We have already received most valuable 
<lb/> help from Lady Mahon and others in 
<lb/> the country, who would then contribute 
<lb/> to your centre.</p>
<p>I enclose some literature and a copy of 
<lb/> our leaflet, and if your Committee 
<lb/> can possibly undertake this work, we 
<lb/> shall be pleased to supply any further 
<lb/>information.</p> 
<p> The demand for moss dressings has 
<lb/> increased with such unexpected rapidity, 
<lb/> that it is absolutely essential to 
<lb/> organise its collection on a much larger 
<lb/> scale than we have done up to the
<lb/> present.</p>
