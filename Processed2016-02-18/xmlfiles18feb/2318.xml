                            <p>A letter Spender from sir Wilfrid Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968).  In this letter, Spender writes that he is hungry in two ways, both for his dinner and for 'my rabbit pie' (his pet name for Lady Lillian being 'pink rabbit'). He gives details of a country excursion he made upon his horse Fanny, whose tendency towards distraction he compares to Lillian's propensity to 'swerve into hatshops' and 'loiter at the local Debenham's'. He concludes that Fanny is the better walking companion of the two. Spender also plans a holiday for Lillian. The letter is unfinished.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>
