                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968). In this letter Spender writes that he will be moving to a new position the next day. He also briefly mentions Ulster politics, his mother's health, and the generous positivity of The Times' representation of the Ulster Division. He revels in the thought of Lillian 'on the seashore with Sredward (Edward Carson) and Lady C, getting pinker and pinker in the hot sun'.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<salute>My Dear Lil</salute></opener>
<p>A perfect day &amp; we seem
<lb/> miles away from the events of
<lb/>last week. The letters from 
<lb/>home help to complete the
<lb/><del>dil></del> illusion. </p>
<p>Elsie's letters show
<lb/>immense pleasure in her
<lb/>work. I'm so glad. </p>
<p>Singleton &amp; I leave early
<lb/> tomorrow for a new destination.
 <lb/>We hope it only means that
<lb/>the Division is being taken
<lb/> <del>up</del> somewhere to reorganize,
<lb/>&amp; that we shall again return
<lb/>to the more pleasant country
<lb/>where we now are. </p>
<p>I have just read the MP 
<lb/>leader - Friday's - which must
<lb/>be unpleasant reading to BL,
<lb/>because every word of it rings
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="6025" facs="#L1916_2290_img_6025"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>out it truth. In this world 
<lb/>the honest man - such as I 
<lb/>still believe BL to be - has 
<lb/>no chance against the Squiffy
<lb/>crew. </p>
<p>I am not writing to 
<lb/>Burlington tho' I think of 
<lb/>you on the sea <hi rend="superscript">shore</hi> with Siredward
<lb/>&amp; Lady C, getting pinker &amp; 
<lb/>pinker I the hot sun. </p>
<p>It is wonderful to me how
<lb/> Mater has stood the past
<lb/>week so well . I think she
 <lb/>feels that the responsibility is
 <lb/>on you, &amp; if you manage <del>the</del>  all
<lb/>right she can. </p>
<p>The Times has certainly let 
<lb/>itself go over the Ulster Div-
<lb/>far more than the MP  . Perhaps
<lb/>it feels some qualms &amp; hopes
<lb/>to soothe them.</p>
        
    
         
        <pb n="6026" facs="#L1916_2290_img_6026"/>
        
        
           
            <p>It is very curious that
<lb/> the Times should have
<lb/>been generous in its praise
<lb/>&amp; not the MP, but the
<lb/>latter is probably waiting
<lb/>for details. I hope so any-
<lb/>how or I shall be greatly
<lb/> disappointed. Perhaps one of 
<lb/>the 2 families will have
<lb/> kept the cuttings in Tuesday
<lb/>&amp; Wednesday's Times &amp; 
<lb/>I may see the Belfast 
<lb/>Whig too which is sent to
<lb/>Henry.</p>
