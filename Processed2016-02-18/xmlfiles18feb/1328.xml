                            <p>A letter from H. G Brabazon, secretary of the Irish Professional Photographer's Association, to Robert Chalmers, under-secretary for Ireland (1856-1938). The letter concerns the damage to Dublin businesses due to the Rising. Brabazon states that the Irish Professional Photographer's Association have resolved to condemn the actions of the rebels and call on the government to fully compensate the men who have had property and business damaged. It goes on to state a copy of the resolution has been sent to Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), David Lloyd George (1863-1945), Edward Carson (1854-1935) and John Redmond (1856-1918).</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Robert Chalmers was sent to Ireland as replacement under-secretary for Sir Matthew Nathan, who had resigned along with Augustine Birrell, his chief secretary, following the outbreak of the Easter Rising in 1916.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute></opener>
<p>At a special meeting held in the Gresham Hotel Dublin on the 
<lb/>night of the 25th, May, the following resolution was proposed and se-
<lb/>conded.</p>
<p>''That the members of the Irish Professional Photographers As-
<lb/>sociation condemn and deplore the recent regretable disturbance, and 
<lb/>we consider it the bounden duty of the Government to fully compensate 
<lb/>those whose property and business were destroyed, giving fullconsid-
<lb/>eration to the question of consequential damage, and we are of the
<lb/>opinion that it would be unjust to fix the amount of compensation on
<lb/>the basis of Insurance."</p>
<p>That copies of this resolution be sent to the Prime Minister
<lb/>The Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, Sir Robert Chalmers Under Secretary for
<lb/>Ireland, Sir Edward Carson M. P. Mr John Redmond M. P. the six Dublin
<lb/>members of Parliament, and Press.</p>

<closer><salute>I remain, Sir,
<lb/>Your most obedient servant,</salute>
