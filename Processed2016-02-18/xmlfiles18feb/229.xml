                            <p>Letter from the Patrick Langford Beazley to his son, Piaras (1881-1965).  Patrick writes to Piaras concerning the blackouts, describing various motor accidents with night time collisions. Patrick closes stating that 'nearly every young man here is now wearing khaki or an armlet.' The day before, 2 March 1916, the Military Service Act came into force, introducing conscription across Britain.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Patrick Langford Beazley was  born near Killarney, Co. Kerry, son of a tenant who had been evicted from the Lansdowne estate. The Beazleys were an old family in Kerry, of English origin.  Married with Nancy (Nanny) Hickey, he was the father of Piaras Béaslaí. He was the editor of the Catholic Times from 1884 until his death in the early 1920s. Piaras Béaslaí (born Percy Frederick Beazley) was an English born writer, revolutionary, politician, language revivalist, journalist and a member of the IRB. In February of 1916 he published the Fàinne, a publication to organise Gaelic speakers. He soon abandoned it and became involved in politics and would later fight in the Easter Rising. He wrote twenty plays between 1913 and 1939.</p>

My dearest Pierce,

We were very glad to get your letter of the 27th (?), especially as it was a considerable time - two or three weeks - since we had heard from you.

It was pleasant to know you had been very busy, because it meant earning, though hard work. I hope the opportunities have proved no less favourable since. Langford told us in his letter that...

you were well and looking well. I hope you will take good care of yourself in the trying weather and let us hear from you. Here the weather could scarcely be more trying. It varies from day to day and several times in the day sometimes. Today it has been threatening to snow, but has not actually done so. The darkness at night, however, is the greatest trial. It is really terribly disconcerting. There are numbers of cars in which people have been hurt through colliding with lampposts and other obstacles of the kind. Mrs. Rose dashed (?) into a tall letterbox and smashed her false teeth.

Mother and I are quite well, thank gad, but have no news. Nearly every young man here now is wearing Khaki or an armlet (?). Evidently a great many men are want(ing) jobs (?). With fondest love from Mother and Myself, Always affectionately, Father.

<p>We were very glad to 
<lb/>get your letter of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, 
<lb/>ult. especially as it was 
<lb/>a considerable time &#x2014; two 
<lb/>or three weeks &#x2014; since we 
<lb/>had heard from you.It was 
<lb/>pleasant to know you had 
<lb/>been very busy, because it 
<lb/>meant earning, though hard 
<lb/>work. I hope the opportun&#x2014;
<lb/>ities have proved no less 
<lb/>favourable since. Langford 
<lb/>told us in his letter that
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="576" facs="#L1916_229_img_576"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>you were well and looking well. 
<lb/>I hope you will take 
<lb/>good care of yourself in 
<lb/>the trying weather and let 
<lb/>us hear from you. Here 
<lb/>the weather could scarcely 
<lb/>be more trying. It varies 
<lb/>from day to day and several 
<lb/>times in the day sometimes. 
<lb/>Today it has been threatening 
<lb/>to snow, but has not ac&#x2014;
<lb/>tually done so. The dark&#x2014;
<lb/>ness at night, however, is 
<lb/>the greatest trial. It is 
<lb/>really terribly disconcerting. 
<lb/>There are numbers of cars 
<lb/>in which people have been 
<lb/>hurt through colliding 
<pb/>
<lb/>with lampposts and other 
<lb/>obstacles of the kind. Mrs. 
<lb/>Rose dashed into a tall 
<lb/>letterbox and smashed her 
<lb/>false teeth. An Irish girl 
<lb/>who is in service near 
<lb/><sic>hear</sic> walked up to a lamp 
<lb/>post and tried to go around 
<lb/>it, with the result that her 
<lb/>face was battered. Mother 
<lb/>and I are quite well, 
<lb/>thank God, but have no 
<lb/>news. Nearly every young 
<lb/>man here now is wear&#x2014;
<lb/>ing Khaki or an armlet. 
<lb/>Evidently a great many men 
<lb/>are <sic>wanted</sic> <unclear>jobs</unclear>.</p> 
<p>With fondest love from 
<lb/>Mother and Myself.</p>
