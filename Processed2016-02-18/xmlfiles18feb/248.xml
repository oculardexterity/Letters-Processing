                            <p>A letter from Eamonn T Dore to James Ryan (1891-1970). Dore writes to Ryan, who had already been released from Frongach, about people at home and fills him in on the condition of the other prisoners.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>James Ryan  studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. Eamonn Dore was a member of the Irish Volunteers and served as a bodyguard to Sean MacDiarmada, one of the leaders of the Rising. He was subsequently imprisoned in Frongach internment camp.</p>

My dear Jim
Received yours a few days ago and I must confess I envy the bl~~~~- fine time you are having. I hope who you know and all the boys are well. Doyle and Mul. I suppose are still enjoying themselves. Are they residents in the "Coombe" still?
Make it your business to meet Mul. (Mulcahy) when you get this and tell him send on my two Cunninghams per return as I want to do a bit of work. Do not forget to give him my address

<note>you can get them. I think Mul. has them. Remember me to all yours. Hoping you are in the pink. Yours, Eamonn. Murt will write in a few days. E.P.S. Tell all the boys I enquired for them. E.</note>

<salute>My dear Jim,</salute></opener>
<p>Received yours a few
<lb/> days ago and I must confess I
<lb/> envy the <unclear>bl&#x2014;</unclear> fine time you are
<lb/> having. I hope who you know and
<lb/> all the boys are well. Doyle and
<lb/> <unclear>Mul.</unclear> I suppose are still enjoying
<lb/> themselves. Are they residents in
<lb/> the "Coombe"  still?</p>

<p>Make it your business to
<lb/> meet <unclear>Mcl</unclear>.(Mulcahy) when you
<lb/> get this and tell him send on
<lb/> my two Cunninghams per return
<lb/> as I want to do a bit of work.
<lb/> Do not forget to give him my address<pb/>

<note><lb/>you can get them. I think Mul. has them. Remember me to all
<lb/> yours. Hoping
<lb/> you are in the pink.
<lb/><salute>Yours,</salute> <signed>Eamonn.</signed></note><!-- the text in this Marginal Note is actually a continuation of the text from page 2 --> 
<note>
<lb/>.P.S. Tell all the boys
<lb/> I enquired for them 
<lb/> if that will do  them
<lb/> any good.

            <lb/>and see that he sends them on
<lb/> immediately. If you could resurrect
<lb/> a "Halliburton" send it on with
<lb/> them.</p>
<p>Have you had an interview
<lb/> with Coffey yet? What kind of
<lb/> form is he in? I suppose Joe
<lb/> Murray will make another burst
<lb/> at the Autumn exams. Does he
<lb/> play Snooker at the Arcade still.
<lb/> Whenever you can find enough
<lb/> money i.e. without any private
<lb/> interviews with who you know
<lb/> send us on some grub.</p>
<lb/>All the boys here are well.
<lb/> The weather is <sic>awfull</sic>. Any news
<lb/> that's worth having send it in
<lb/> your next. Try and have those
<lb/> books sent as soon as possible,
<lb/> and don't forget looking up a
<lb/> "Halliburton" also "Mahon's" notes if<pb/>
