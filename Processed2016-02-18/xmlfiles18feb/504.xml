                            <p>A letter from writer, war correspondent and crusading journalist Henry W. Nevinson (1846-1951) to Gertrude Bannister (later Parry), a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. He writes that he has forwarded appeals for support for Casement to a number of individuals, including poet W.B. Yeats (1865-1939). The appeals were written by playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856-1960) and a Lieutenant Davin. The recipients were encouraged to write to the British Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928) in support of Casement. Nevinson also refers to including his own name on one of the petitions put together.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Casement was hanged on 3 August 1916</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. In the 1900s Nevinson had worked closely with Casement in raising awareness about slavery in western Africa and he worked extensively for the campaign to save Casement.</p>
