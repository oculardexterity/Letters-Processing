                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

My dearest mother - we are now back in
our old quarters &amp; what a dreary spot it is
compared with the place we left. We arrived 
on Saturday &amp; were told we should find that
the previous Division had carried out all
kinds of improvements but of course as we
quite expected, practically nothing had been done
in this direction. There is a very big scheme
now on foot to improve all the <gap/> areas
so as to make them more comfortable for the
men - for instance repairing building, constructing 
wash houses, drying rooms, incinerators, etc etc. 
The regiments are therefore being largely employed
on this work &amp; if it is not exactly soldiering it
is a welcome change to the continual training.
Machine Gunmen &amp; Grenadiers however have
to continue at their own special work - I rather
wish it was otherwise as it would be a pleasant
change to be turned on to something new. You
have no idea how deadly dull it is here.

little village about the size of Portaferry, with
no railway near at hand &amp; away from the 
sea. When we can

My dearest mother &#x2014; we are now back in<lb/> our old quarters &amp; what a dreary spot it is<lb/> compared with the place we left. We arrived <lb/> on Saturday &amp; were told we should find that<lb/> the previous Division had carried out all<lb/> kinds of improvements but of course as we<lb/> quite expected, practically nothing had been done<lb/> in this direction. There is a very big scheme<lb/> now on foot to improve all the billeting areas<lb/> so as to make them more comfortable for the<lb/> men &#x2014; for instance repairing buildings, constructing <lb/> wash houses, drying rooms, incinerators, etc etc. <lb/> The regiments are therefore being largely employed<lb/> on this work &amp; if it is not exactly soldiering it<lb/> is a welcome change to the continual training.<lb/> Machine Gunmen &amp; Grenadiers however have<lb/> to continue at their own special work &#x2014; I rather<lb/> wish it was otherwise as it would be a pleasant<lb/> change to be turned on to something new. You<lb/> have no idea how deadly dull it is here.<lb/> Imagine what it would be like to be in a<lb/> little village about the size of Portaferry, with<lb/> no railway near at hand &amp; away from the <lb/> sea.

<pb/>it did not seem so bad but to return here<lb/> after being in a good area is very disagreeable &#x2014;<lb/> we should all have much <sic>prefered</sic> going back to<lb/> the trenches.

<opener><dateline><date>11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Jan. 1916</date></dateline>
<salute>My dearest mother &#x2014;</salute></opener> <p>we are now back in
<lb/> our old quarters &amp; what a dreary spot it is
<lb/> compared with the place we left. We arrived 
<lb/> on Saturday &amp; were told we should find that
<lb/> the previous Division had carried out all
<lb/> kinds of improvements but of course as we
<lb/> quite expected, practically nothing had been done
<lb/> in this direction.</p><p> There is a very big scheme
<lb/> now on foot to improve all the billeting areas
<lb/> so as to make them more comfortable for the
<lb/> men &#x2014; for instance repairing buildings, constructing 
<lb/> wash houses, drying rooms, incinerators, etc etc. 
<lb/> The regiments are therefore being largely employed
<lb/> on this work &amp; if it is not exactly soldiering it
<lb/> is a welcome change to the continual training.
<lb/> Machine Gunmen &amp; Grenadiers however have
<lb/> to continue at their own special work &#x2014; I rather
<lb/> wish it was otherwise as it would be a pleasant
<lb/> change to be turned on to something new. </p><p>You
<lb/> have no idea how deadly dull it is here.
<lb/> Imagine what it would be like to be in a
<lb/> little village about the size of Portaferry, with
<lb/> no railway near at hand &amp; away from the 
<lb/> sea. </p><p>When we came here for the first time

            <lb/>it did not seem so bad but to return here
<lb/> after being in a good area is very disagreeable &#x2014;
<lb/> we should all have much <sic>prefered</sic> going back to
<lb/> the trenches. </p><p>Yesterday I had rather a 
<lb/> nasty bilious turn &#x2014; very sick all day &amp; headache
<lb/> so had to stay in bed. Think some of our 
<lb/> food must have been bad as 2 others on the H. Q
<lb/> Staff were also feeling off colour. Today however
<lb/> I have <add>been</add> practically all right again &amp; able to be about
<lb/> as usual.</p><p> The parcel from Thompsons &#x2014; I
<lb/>mean Malcolmsons &#x2014; arrived all right &amp; also one
<lb/> from Pattersons &amp; I have just been told there is
<lb/> a small wood box for me in the Bde. office which
<lb/> is probably the one with apples from home. Thanks
<lb/> ever so much for all. </p><p>Would you please send
<lb/> me by post 2 tins of solid Methylated Spirit for my
<lb/> "Little Kitchener" Lamp. You will be able to get it in
<lb/> Mitchells.</p><p> Was so glad to hear from your last
<lb/> letter that Kathleen is getting along all right though  I
<lb/> am sure it must be very tedious for her that the
<lb/> progress is so slow.</p><p> With my fondest
<lb/>love to all</p>
