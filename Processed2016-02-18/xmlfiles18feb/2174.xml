                            <p>A letter from James Davidson (1877-1916) to his Mother, Clara Mary Davidson. James is delighted to have received a letter from Kathleen and to learn that she is improving. They are looking forward to spending Christmas in comfortable quarters, although he notes that the plum pudding ordered from Edinburgh had not yet arrived, but since several others have they were not worried. He writes that he will not going back to England for special training. While it would have been nice to go home for a while, he would be conflicted as it would mean separation from the men with whom he has trained for so many months. He ends by writing that it has rained almost every day.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a large correspondence from Captain James Davidson to his parents. Davidson, who was Managing Director of the Sirocco Engineering Works in Belfast, served with 13 Royal Irish Rifles and the Machine Gun Corps. His letters describe his experiences while training in England and serving in France. He was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>I nearly always have
<lb/>to write my letters at night after
<lb/>dinner &amp; tonight I am later than
<lb/>usual beginning so must make a 
<lb/>very short one do. Was so pleased
<lb/>to get a letter from Kathleen yest.
<lb/>&amp; to know that she is steadily improving
<lb/>though slowly. What bad luck that Douglas
<lb/>cant get leave home. We are all
<lb/>looking forward to spending a very 
<lb/>cheery Xmas. Aren't we lucky to be
<lb/>in comfortable quarters!  The Plum
<lb/>Pudding you ordered from Edinburgh has
<lb/>not arrived so far, but lots of others have,
<lb/>so if it is late it wont really matter
<lb/>&amp; we will enjoy it some other evening.
<lb/>I was informed yest. that I would be
<lb/>going back to England almost at once
