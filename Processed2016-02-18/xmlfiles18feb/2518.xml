                            <p>A letter from Peter Mooney (b.1886) to his sister, Katie (b. 1884). Peter requests tobacco and a nail scissors when Katie is able to write again. He apologises for such a short letter and promises to write a longer letter over the weekend. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Orphaned at age 7, Peter and his sister Katie were raised by their uncle William and his wife Mary in Caulstown. While there are no surviving enlistment papers for Peter, his War Badge Index Record shows his enlistment date as 18 October 1915. He served with the Royal Artillery and later transferred to the Royal Engineers where he was promoted to the rank of Sergeant. He served in several places at the Western Front, including Ypres, St. Omer and Passchendael. Peter and Kate were avid correspondents. This letter part of a collection of over ninety surviving letters.</p>

<salute>Dear Katie</salute></opener>
<p>I received your letter this 
<lb/> morning.  I am glad to see 
<lb/> by it that you are all going 
<lb/> on well. I got the papers 
<lb/> alright they are great company
<lb/> to me.  You may send me
<lb/> on more <sic>tobbaco</sic> when you 
<lb/> are writing again.  I wrote 
<lb/> to Paddy to-day also.  I 
<lb/> had a letter from John 
<lb/><unclear>Farrell</unclear> this morning. 
<lb/> He is minding the greyhounds 
<lb/> well </p>

            <lb/>tell <unclear>Pat</unclear> that I was asking 
<lb/> for him.  You might send me
<lb/> on a very small <unclear>scissors</unclear> for 
<lb/> cutting my nails. Recruits 
<lb/> are coming in here any day 
<lb/> the wonder is were they are 
<lb/> coming from.  You will have 
<lb/> to forgive me for writing such 
<lb/> a short letter. I will write 
<lb/> on Sunday again.  I will now 
<lb/> say Good-Bye to all for 
<lb/> the present</p>

            <p>You might send me down 
<lb/> my Sunday boots if they are 
<lb/> soled they would be useful 
<lb/> in the morning when i get 
<lb/> up.  We are having a lot of rain here to-day.  Tell Mrs 
<lb/> McAuly &amp; John that i was 
<lb/> asking for them also the 
<lb/> little ones.  Do not forget 
<lb/> to remember me to James 
<lb/> &amp; Mrs Smith i do think 
<lb/> of them all from time to
<lb/> time.  This is one thing that 
<lb/> cheers me here in that I 
<lb/> may safely say that i have 
<lb/> everyone good-will.  I will 
<lb/> now say Good-Bye &amp; God Bless you all. </p>
