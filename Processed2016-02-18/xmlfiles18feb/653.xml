The letter you wrote to me before Easter arrived here last night. I know you have been anxious to know if I am still above the <hi rend="underline">sod</hi>; well thank God I am but I am sorry to say thru

<salute>Dear Mamma,</salute></opener>
<p>It seems as if
<lb/> I had a terrible nightmare
<lb/> so terrible &amp; strange things
<lb/> I have been through since
<lb/> I wrote you before Easter.
<lb/> The letter you wrote to
<lb/> me before Easter arrived
<lb/> here last night. I know
<lb/> you have been anxious
<lb/> to know if I am still
<lb/> above the <hi rend="underline">sod.</hi> well thank
<lb/> God I am but I am
<lb/> sorry to say <sic>theres</sic>
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="1605" facs="#L1916_653_img_1605"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>many a one in <sic>there</sic> last
<lb/> resting place who were in
<lb/> the pink of health hardly
<lb/> a week ago &amp; but for sheer
<lb/> luck there would be double
<lb/> the number. Such slaughter
<lb/> &amp; wholesale destruction no
<lb/> one in Ireland ever saw.
<lb/> Here we were on Easter Monday
<lb/> morning all unconscious of
<lb/> what was to happen in
<lb/> a few hours. <hi rend="underline">Luckily</hi> we
<lb/> only got a <hi rend="underline">half</hi> <hi rend="underline">holiday.</hi> You
<lb/> will see how this saved
<lb/> the lot of us. We were 
<lb/> dismissed from drill at 
<lb/>12. o.c. &amp; of course we all
<lb/> went post-haste to dress
<lb/> to go down town for the
<lb/> remainder of the day.
<lb/> Just as I was having a wash
<lb/> I heard a volley of shots<pb/>

 <lb/>right outside the Barracks.
<lb/> In three minutes we were
<lb/> rushed into the streets with
<lb/> full equipment, Rifles, &amp; as
<lb/> much ammunition as we
<lb/> could carry The houses
<lb/> on all sides were full of
<lb/> <sic>Sein‚Äìfeiners</sic> &amp; the minute
<lb/> we turned the corner
<lb/> down goes an officer &amp;
<lb/> several of the men in
<lb/> our party. We got down
<lb/> flat on stomachs on the
<lb/> road &amp; here our first
<lb/> pitched battle raged.
<lb/> I forgot to mention that
<lb/> while we were both hard
<lb/> at it the men, women,
<lb/> &amp; children who hadn't
<lb/>  time to clear from the
<lb/> street were screeching,
<lb/>&amp; crying to the solders
        
    
         
        <pb n="1606" facs="#L1916_653_img_1606"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>to save them &amp; they too
<lb/> were shot down all over
<lb/> the place by the <sic>Sein-feiners</sic>
<lb/> from the windows but I
<lb/> suppose the bullets were
<lb/> meant for us. It was
<lb/> awful to see the unfortunate
<lb/> wounded ones lying on
<lb/> the street crying for
<lb/> <hi rend="underline">water</hi> <hi rend="underline">water</hi> &amp; every time
<lb/> we went to rescue them
<lb/> the <sic>Sein-fs</sic>   fired on us.
<lb/>  Red - cross, white Cross,
<lb/>  priest, or parson all
<lb/> were fired on. Dozens of
<lb/> people rushed into the
<lb/> Barracks for safety.</p>
<p> To continue about the fighting
<lb/> we succeeded in driving
<lb/> them out of the houses
<lb/> on one side of the
<lb/> street but only when
        
    
         
        <pb n="1607" facs="#L1916_653_img_1607"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>we rushed into the houses
<lb/> with the bayon<add>e</add>ts. This
<lb/> always seemed to put the
<lb/> fear of God in their heart.
<lb/> They too had bayonets but
<lb/> they never dared to rush
<lb/> us. There were a few
<lb/> houses we couldn‚Äôt subdue
<lb/> with rifle fire alone &amp; we
<lb/> got bombs &amp; blew them
<lb/> &amp; the <sic>Sein f's</sic> to some
<lb/> where in no - where.
<lb/> But this was only childs
<lb/> play till we got to the
<lb/> centre of the city where
<lb/> they were in their
<lb/> thousands &amp; armed
<lb/> to the teeth. We were
 <lb/>outnumbered &amp; had to
<lb/> keep on the defensive
<lb/> till reinforcements
        
    
         
        <pb n="1608" facs="#L1916_653_img_1608"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>arrived. They were in the
<lb/> chimneys firing through
<lb/> loop - holes &amp; on the roofs
<lb/> sniping for further orders.
<lb/> We worried them for 3
<lb/> days &amp; then the Artillery
<lb/> came along. Before a
<lb/> dozen shells fell in the
<lb/> G. P. O. out comes a
<lb/> white sheet. The unfortunate
<lb/> devils were like ghosts
<lb/> when we took them out.
<lb/> Inside there were pieces
<lb/> of <sic>Sein - fs</sic> which told
<lb/> their <del>old</del> <add>own</add> tale. They had
<lb/> sufficient food &amp; ammunition
<lb/> to last a 3 month‚Äôs <sic>seige.</sic>
<lb/> The same thing was happening
<lb/> all through the city unti
l<lb/> three days when practically
<lb/> all surrendered.</p> 
<pb/>
<p>At night time the whole
<lb/> city was in darkness. Lights
<lb/> of any description were
<lb/> fired upon. The reason for
<lb/> this was that they were
<lb/> signalling from one window
<lb/> &amp; housetop to another
<lb/> with flash lights.</p>
<p>The fighting at night
<lb/> time only took place
<lb/> between the snipers &amp;
<lb/> our sentries. The last
<lb/> night I was on sentry
<lb/>  <sic>didnt</sic> the beggars get
<lb/> at the Power Station &amp;
<lb/> turn on all the streets
<lb/> lights &amp; immediately
<lb/> several volleys
<lb/> rang out. I happened
<lb/> to be right under one
<lb/> of the lamps so I
        
    
         
        <pb n="1609" facs="#L1916_653_img_1609"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>took point blank aim at
<lb/> the lamp itself which was
<lb/> too high to reach other
<lb/> wise &amp; I fear you never
<lb/> see the same one in Dublin
<lb/> again. Now I could keep
<lb/> on telling you about
<lb/> incidents such as these
<lb/> for a week &amp; hair &#x2014;
<lb/> breadth escapes which
<lb/> we wouldn‚Äôt notice.
<lb/> But <sic>theres</sic> something
<lb/> else I‚Äôm sure you would
<lb/> like to know. How
<lb/> did we get our food
<lb/> our sleep  etc.</p>
<p> As regards food we 
<lb/>lived on Bully Beef
<lb/> &amp; dog biscuits &amp;
        
    
         
        <pb n="1610" facs="#L1916_653_img_1610"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>when we happened to
<lb/> meet a stray morsel
<lb/> it died a noble death.
<lb/>  We slept on the streets,
<lb/> in the streets, on top
<lb/> of houses, in stables,
<lb/> outhouses &amp; anything
<lb/> we could get. No 
<lb/>such luxury as a
<lb/> doze  with  clothes <sic>of</sic>
<lb/> not even equipment.
<lb/> Even though we might
<lb/> be asleep  just one
<lb/> shout from the lonely
<lb/> sentry who watched
<lb/> over us &amp; we stood
<lb/> up ready for any 
<lb/>emergency.</p>
        
    
         
        <pb n="1611" facs="#L1916_653_img_1611"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/><sic>Its</sic> almost a thing of 
<lb/>the past now &amp; <sic>Im</sic>
<lb/> sure the majority are
<lb/> glad. I had the pleasure
<lb/> of helping to bury the
<lb/> three Ring-leaders who
<lb/> were Pierce, Connolly
<lb/> &amp; Byrne. They were
<lb/> brought out of their
<lb/> cells in <hi rend="underline">‚ÄúArbour Hill‚Äù</hi>
<lb/> jail where I &amp; a few
<lb/> more solders were
<lb/> guarding. They were
<lb/> blindfolded &amp; their
<lb/> hands tied behind
<lb/> their back &amp; six
<lb/> volleys fired into
        
    
         
        <pb n="1612" facs="#L1916_653_img_1612"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>each man They were
<lb/> buried just as they fell,
<lb/> no coffin or any other
<lb/> covering. Thrown into
<lb/> a hole &amp; covered with
<lb/> quick lime &amp; then
<lb/> sufficient clay to keep
<lb/> their toes from turning
<lb/> up. This must suffice
<lb/> for the present as duty
<lb/> calls me elsewhere &amp;
<lb/> I hope this finds you
<lb/> all like myself over
<lb/> the sod &amp; then
<lb/> you <sic>neednt</sic> grumble.<lb/>
