                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960) to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968). In this letter, Spender gives an account of a recent ride he went for on his horse, Fanny. Midway through the ride, he realised that he had 'demoted' himself to captain (from Colonel) by accidentally wearing the wrong epaulette, and so had to speed home by a circuitous route to avoid social embarrassment. Spender tells Lillian that he still cannot get used to his recent promotion.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>

<p>I hear the mail train has

<p> I may have a busier day tomorrow
<lb/>&amp; consequently less time to write so
<lb/>I will begin now after dinner tho'
<lb/>with very little to say. It was a 
<lb/>hot day and I went out for a ride
<lb/>on Fanny. Douglas put<del>s</del> away my
<lb/>old coat saying you would not approve
<lb/>of it any more, but it was rather
<lb/>thinner than my others so I dug it 
<lb/>out for the ride. It struck me as
<lb/>I went along that I was greeted a
<lb/>little more casually than had lately
<lb/>been the case, but Fanny was far

<lb/>to take real notice of it. Suddenly

<lb/>She probably thought me
<lb/>quite mad when I passed the 
<lb/>obvious road &amp; and took her down
<lb/>a steep and precipitous path back
<lb/>to behind the Church &amp; so to my
<lb/>house. Can't you see a b w slinking
<lb/> in? Owing to the fact that most of
