                            <p>Herbert Henry Asquith was Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. Colonel Maurice George Moore, author, soldier and politician, was the younger brother of the writer George Moore. Having reached the rank of colonel in 1902, he resigned his commission in 1906 over matters of principle during the Boer War. A member of the provisional committee of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, he was made the organisation's Inspector General, spending much of 1914 organising the troops in Ireland. In 1916 he collected a petition with Agnes O'Farrelly asking for a reprieve of the death sentence against Roger Casement.</p>

Sir,
The most deplorable revulsion of feeling that has ever occurred in Ireland happened after the shooting of the Irish rebels.
A new execution is about to take place; at first people did not believe it possible, and we who have been appealing for mercy avoided public appeals or speeches for fear of exciting the people. But now excitement is rising and public declamation cannot be stopped and if the execution is carried out, not only do I fear an enduring feeling of hate, which will keep the two countries apart for years, but in all probability some wild act of revenge, such as the Phoenix Park murders, that will startle Europe and America.
Be wise; stop this execution; if not take a terrible responsibility on yourself. At all events we have warned you.
I remain
Your obedient servant,
Maurice Moore

<salute>Sir,</salute></opener>
<p>The most deplorable revulsion of feeling that has ever
<lb/> occurred in Ireland happened after the shooting of the Irish
<lb/> rebels.</p>
<p>A new execution is about to take place; at first
<lb/> people did not believe it possible, and we who have been
<lb/> appealing for mercy avoided public appeals or speeches
<lb/> for fear of exciting the people. But now excitement is rising
<lb/> and public declamation cannot be stopped and if the execution
<lb/> is carried out, not only do I fear an enduring feeling of
<lb/> hate, which will keep the two countries apart for years,
<lb/> but in all probability some wild act of revenge, such as the
<lb/> Phoenix Park murders, that will startle Europe and America.</p>
<p>Be wise; stop this execution; if not take a terrible
<lb/> responsibility on yourself. At all events we have warned you.</p>

<lb/>Your obedient servant,
