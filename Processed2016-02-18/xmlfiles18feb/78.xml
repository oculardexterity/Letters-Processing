                            <p>Letter from prisoner of war, Private B. Ward, Connaught Rangers, to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Private Ward was then held in a German prisoner of war camp in Limburg, Germany. In the letter, he refers to previous unanswered correspondence, thanks Lady Clonbrock for her fortnightly aid packages and requests new boots and underclothes. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (n√©e Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

<lb/>the month they have sent them 
<lb/>but I have not received them 
<lb/>up to the present. Dear Madam, 
<lb/>I would be very thankful to 
<lb/>you if you would let me know
