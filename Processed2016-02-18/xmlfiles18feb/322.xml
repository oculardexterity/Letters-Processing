                            <p>Letter from Charles Wyndham Wynne (1895-1917) to his mother, Alice. Charles writes about his leave being postponed while stationed in Donegal, his imminent trip to Bexhill for siege training and some hope that he'll enjoy his time in England upon completion of the course.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Charles Wynne served as a captain in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. His application to the Royal Flying Corps was denied in 1916 due to his poor eyesight. Charles ultimately died of wounds received at Armentieres, June 1917.</p>

	I am going to Beshill [sic] for a seige [sic] course and even when that's finished I expect I shall be a good time in England so may get leave later in the summer when the weather's better.

Dear Mother,
		Just a line before post goes. I am much disgusted that my leave is I'm afraid strafed. I rang up the hotel yesterday but owing to the line between here and the Dunree exchange being in bad order and the idiocy of Miss Earl or whoever was at the other end I didn't get much through. I may possibly still get from Tues and in any case hope

<date>Monday</date>
<salute>Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Just a line before 
<lb/>post goes. I am much 
<lb/>disgusted that my leave is 
<lb/>I'm afraid <unclear>strafed</unclear>. I rang 
<lb/>up the hotel yesterday but 
<lb/>owing to the line between 
<lb/>here and the Dunree exchange 
<lb/>being in bad order and the 
<lb/>idiocy of <del>whoever</del> Miss Earl or 
<lb/>whoever I was at the other end 
<lb/>I didn't get much through. 
<lb/>I may possibly still get <unclear>from</unclear> 
<lb/>Tues and in any case hope

<salute>Dear Mother,</salute></opener>
<p>Just a line before 
<lb/>post goes. I am much 
<lb/>disgusted that my leave is 
<lb/>I'm afraid <unclear>strafed</unclear>. I rang 
<lb/>up the hotel yesterday but 
<lb/>owing to the line between 
<lb/>here and the Dunree exchange 
<lb/>being in bad order and the 
<lb/>idiocy of <del>whoever</del> Miss Earl or 
<lb/>whoever I was at the other end 
<lb/>I didn't get much through. 
<lb/>I may possibly still get <unclear>from</unclear> 
<lb/>Tues and in any case hope

            <lb/>to have between the the morning 
<lb/>and evening mail on Thursday.
<lb/>I am going to <sic>Beshill</sic> for a 
<lb/><sic>seige</sic> course and even when 
<lb/>that's finished I expect I shall 
<lb/>be a good time in England 
<lb/>so may get leave later in 
<lb/>the summer when the weather's 
<lb/>better.</p>
<p>Nothing much to report 
<lb/>from here. The two infantry officers 
<lb/>turned out very nice &#x2014; one 
<lb/>particularly nice but after five 
<lb/><del><gap/></del> days they both got 
<pb/>
<lb/>orders for the front.</p>
<p>Now I must stop for post. 
<lb/>I hope at any rate to be 
<lb/>with you on Thursday 
<lb/>morning.</p>
