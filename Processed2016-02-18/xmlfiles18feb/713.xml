                            <p>Letter from Sir Ivor Churchill Guest, Lord Wimborne (1873-1939) to Sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859-1929). The letter was written after the suppression of the Rising and two days before the first executions of the leaders. Wimborne praises Maxwell for the 'complete success' of his forces in suppressing the Rising, expresses appreciation for the measures adopted by General Lovick Friend, whom Maxwell had replaced, and describes the conduct of the officers and men as 'admirable' and deserving of the 'fullest recognition'. A note on the letters tells that the contents were published for the information of the troops.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne, was appointed the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1915. Guest worked closely alongside Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939) in the administration of Ireland. Following the suppression of the Rising, Guest, under pressure, was forced to resign as Lord Lieutenant. A later inquiry into the Rising exonerated Guest and held Augustine Birrell (1850-1933) chiefly responsible for the events that occurred. Guest would continue to serve as Lord Lieutenant until 1918. Sir John Henry Grenfell Maxwell (1859 â€“ 1929) was appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising. Before 1916, Maxwell briefly held command of British troops in Egypt, where he successfully organised defences against a Turkish attack in February 1915 and presided over the huge expansion of his command as Egypt became a major British imperial military base. In March 1916, having been superseded as general officer commanding in Egypt, he was recalled home when the Easter Rising broke out.</p>

<lb/> under your command has been admirable, &amp; the courage,
<lb/>resolution &amp; temper exhibited by them under extremely
<lb/>trying &amp; peculiar conditions have been strikingly
