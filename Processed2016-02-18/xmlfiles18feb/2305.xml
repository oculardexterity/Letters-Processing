                            <p>A letter from sir Wilfrid Bliss Spender (1876-1960)  to his wife, Lady Lillian Spender, n√©e Dean, (1880-1968).  In this brief letter Spender informs Lillian that his brother Rex has arrived. He also informs her that he is being made a General Staff Officer in the 4th Army, and will not protest the appointment, although he will regret leaving his brother and the Ulstermen.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Sir Wilfrid Spender was a member of the British Army until 1913 when controversy surrounding his signature of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant resulted in his resignation. Spender was called up for military service in 1914 and from 1915 served in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Throughout the war, Spender wrote a collection of letters to his wife Lady Lillian Spender. The letters date mainly from 1915 to 1918, when Sir Wilfrid was serving in France. The letters concern politics, the Irish question, personal life, and Wilfrid's experience of the Great War. Lady Lillian served in the Ulster Volunteer Nursing Corps during the war, and was an organiser of the Ulster Division Comforts Fund.</p>
