<p>I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you that<lb/>
the Commander-in-Chief, British Army in the Field has represented<lb/>
that officials of different Government Departments occasionally<lb/>
arrive within the British Zone of the Armies without any<lb/>
previous communication having been addressed to him on the<lb/>
subject of their intended visit. He requests that to avoid<lb/>
difficulty, every Department should adopt regulations similar<lb/>
to those in force at the War Office, a copy of which is attached.</p>
<p>The Council would be glad to be informed of the name and<lb/>
designation of the official of your Department who may be<lb/>
appointed to grant the certificate to which reference is made<lb/>
in the Regulations and to move the military authorities in<lb/>
France to issue the necessary pass. These will be communicated<lb/>
to the Adjutant General, Expeditionary Force and the Inspector<lb/>
General of Communications for their information, and will be<lb/>
recorded at the Military Permit Office, Bedford Square.</p>
