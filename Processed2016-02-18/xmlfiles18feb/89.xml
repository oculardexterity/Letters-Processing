                            <p>Letter from a prisoner of war, Private Bernard Ward, Connaught Rangers, to Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). In the letter, Ward mentions that a cousin in Ballinasloe (where Lady Clonbrock was living) was receiving packages from Lady Clonbrock and asks that he could receive some cigarettes as he had no one else to send him goods.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Augusta Caroline Dillon (n√©e Crofton) was the wife of Luke Gerald Dillon (1834-1917), the 4th Baron of Clonbrock, Co. Galway and the daughter of Lord Crofton of Mote Park (Edward Henry Churchill Crofton, 3rd Baron), Co. Roscommon. Aged 75 at the outbreak of war, Lady Clonbrock, worked closely with the Irish Women's Association to send basic necessities to Irish POWs. Many of her care packages went to members of the Connaught Rangers imprisoned in Limburg near Cologne.</p>

Madam,
I trust you will forgive the liberty I take in writing to you. I am a cousin to Charles Ward, Ballinasloe and I heard from his son that you had very kindly sent parcels to him through the Irish Womens Association.
I am also form Ballinasloe, but have resided in Roscommon for a number of years. I have no friends who can send me anything and have received very little since I have been a Prisoner. Consequently I have to depend on the generosity of of my more fortunate comrades which to a sensitive person is not very agreeable. I should be very grateful if a little tobacco could be sent to me, or any consideration my case may meet
I am your Obedient Servant

<salute>Madam,</salute></opener>
<p>I trust you will forgive the liberty I 
<lb/>take in writing to you. I am a cousin to 
<lb/>Charles Ward, Ballinasloe and I heard from 
<lb/>his son that you had very kindly sent parcels 
<lb/>to him through the Irish Womens Association.
<lb/>I am also from Ballinasloe, but have resided 
<lb/>in Roscommon for a number of years. I have 
<lb/>no friends who can send me anything and 
<lb/>have received very little since I have been a 
<lb/>Prisoner. Consequently I have to depend on the 
<lb/>generosity of my more fortunate comrades which 
<lb/>to a sensitive person is not very agreeable. I should 
<lb/>be very grateful if a little tobacco could be sent to 
<lb/>me, or any consideration my case may meet</p>
<salute>I am your Obedient Servant</salute>
