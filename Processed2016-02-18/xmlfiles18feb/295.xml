                            <p>A letter to Eileen Corrigan (d.1993) from a friend, Lucy, referring to the events of 1916. Lucy writes of the limited food supply to the University, the bravery of Eileen and the three other women who made it to Trinity on Easter Monday and of the rescheduling of the exams for those who couldn't make it on account of the military cordon.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Eileen Corrigan had arrived in Dublin on 24 April 1916, the first day of the Easter Rising, from Belfast to sit her exams in the Trinity College. Eileen was one of just four female students who sat their exams as rebellion and counter attack swirled about outside Trinity’s walls. They were rewarded with lunch in Provost Mahafy’s house hosted by his wife, Frances Letitia.</p>

<salute>My Dear Eileen,</salute></opener>
<p>Thank you so 
<lb/>much for your letter
<lb/> it interested &amp;
<lb/> amused me at
<lb/> the safe distance
<lb/> of a past event
<lb/> but I confess I
<lb/> was in consternation
<note>in <unclear>Path</unclear> Road all through the rising. 
<lb/>Food 
<lb/>supply 
<lb/>was a 
<lb/>difficulty,
<lb/><gap/> 
<lb/><gap/> the 
<lb/>fresh eggs.</note>

            <lb/>when I heard of the exploit
<lb/> at the thought of
<lb/> the risk you <unclear>four</unclear>
<lb/> girls ran in
<lb/> coming in, especially
<lb/> the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> day &#x2014;
<lb/> However it will
<lb/> be something to
<lb/> look back on for
<lb/> the rest of your
<lb/> life. I am so
<note><lb/> hoping to see you next autumn,
<lb/> Yours very truly,
<salute><hi rend="underline">Lucy Gwyun</hi></salute></note>
<note>and a load of head one day!</note>

            <lb/>Glad you <add>all</add> got through.
<lb/>Two men failed
<lb/> hopelessly and
<lb/> several others
<lb/> did not come
<lb/> the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> day.
<lb/> The exam is
<lb/> repeated next Monday
<lb/> for the absentees.

            <lb/> was coming up on
<lb/> Monday &amp; got
<lb/> stuck at Howth
<lb/> for a week much
<lb/> to the anxiety of 
<lb/> her people.
<lb/> Miss Sandford 
<lb/> had her degree
<lb/> conferred on the
<lb/> Wednesday before Easter
<lb/> she befriended me
<lb/> the following week
<lb/> as I was with Mrs E.
<lb/> Gwyun &amp; her 5 children
