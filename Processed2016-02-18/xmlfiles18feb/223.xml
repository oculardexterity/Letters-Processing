Lackanalooha, Mallow.
9th, August, 1916.

My Lord,

As Hon. Secretary No. 2 of Mallow Recruiting Committee and in charge of the distribution of the "Certificates of Honour", I am asked by Mr. R. E. Longfield, D. L. to ask you preside as Chairman of our Meeting.

I have asked for the use of the Buttevant Gymnasium Hall, Buttevant Barracks. Also, a band to give some entertainment and we have on hands for Buttevant. 19.

Doneraile. 22. Due from Dublin for Churchtown which is also in the Buttevant District 23.

This would leave a total of 64. which could be given out under your Chairmanship at Buttevant.

Our total vouchers received to date 539.
"Certificates of Honour" issued 456.
To be issued 83.
There are still numbers looking for them.
For five weeks in the Dublin office they inform me they have issued 2.500.

Our meetings have been very successful. Mr. R. E. Longfield D. L. has given us a great assistance and has signed his name as D. L. this has given our meetings a new life and we expect to attract great numbers later.

It is a great stimulus for recruting. In our Mallow District. Lt. O. riordoan has done wonders and is getting numbers of recruits.
