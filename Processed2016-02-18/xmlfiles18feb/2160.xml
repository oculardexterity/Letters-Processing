<salute>Dear Mrs. Tate,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind letter of 24th.</p>
<p>I wish I had been at the funeral, if only to show my regard and respect for the brave and kind old man. It was however almost impossible for me to make the journey.</p>
<p>As regards his affairs, I have no status whatever, and I have no knowledge. The only time that he ever took me into his confidence was<pb/>

at my last visit to him in August '06. All he said was that <sic>Scottie</sic> would, at his death, come on the <sic>S.M.T.</sic> fund for £200 a year, and that he had, in Jim Roche's death, fixed her allowance at that figure, but that she had always exceeded it. That did not surprise me because I had some experiences of <sic>Scottie</sic> in India.</p>
<p>I went on to Cork, and was so much dissatisfied with what I saw there, that I wrote to him, rather forcibly, about the children<gap/>. In his reply he gave me some figures of <sic>Scottie's</sic> expenditure, which did astonish me. Naturally I summise, from your reference to <sic>Scottie's</sic> debts,<pb/>

<p>I cannot sufficiently praise you for sacrificing yourself as you have done, and returning to Abbotsleigh, to help Mabel. Now, I conclude, the executors will attend to every matter.</p>
<p>Yes, I fear that we are too far apart geographically, to be likely to meet. If- as seems possible, my interest in <gap/> and coconuts turns out well, we would let our house for a while - but as <gap/> would be in Italy. Nevertheless we shall continue to hope for a visit from you and the girls.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Tate,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kind 
<lb/>letter of 24th.</p>
<p>I wish I had been at the 
<lb/>funeral, if only to show my 
<lb/>regard and respect for the brave and kind 
<lb/>old man. It was however almost 
<lb/>impossible for me to make the 
<lb/>journey.</p>
<p>As regards his affairs, I have 
<lb/>no status whatever, and I have no 
<lb/>knowledge. The only time that he
<lb/> ever took me into his confidence was

<lb/>All he said was that <sic>Scottie</sic> would, at
<lb/> his death, come on the <sic>S.M.T.</sic> fund
<lb/> for £200 a year, and that he had, on
<lb/> Jim Roche's death, fixed her allowance
<lb/> at that figure, but that she had always
<lb/> exceeded it. That did not surprise
<lb/> me because I had some experiences of
 <sic>Scottie</sic> in India.</p>
<p>I went on to Cork, and was so
<lb/> much dissatisfied with what I saw

<lb/> forcibly, about the children<gap/>. In

<p>I cannot clearly recollect <sic>Ballycastle</sic>
<lb/> I sincerely hope that the change has done
<lb/> your baby good, and that she will soon
<lb/> be quite well. Also that Alec will soon
<lb/> be fit again. She and I have reached an
<lb/> age. My trouble is <sic>stomachic.</sic></p>
<p>I cannot sufficiently praise you
<lb/> for sacrificing yourself as you have done,
<lb/> and returning to Abbotsleigh, to help
<lb/> Mabel. Now, I conclude, the executors
<lb/> will attend to every matter.</p>
<p>Yes, I fear that we are too far
<lb/> apart geographically, to be likely to meet.
<lb/> If- as seems possible, my interest in Rubber
<lb/> and coconuts turns out well, we would let
<lb/> our house for a while - but our <unclear>sojourn</unclear> would
<lb/> be in Italy. Nevertheless we shall continue
<lb/> to hope for a visit from you &amp; the girls.</p>

<opener><dateline><date>27th.Sept.'16.</date></dateline>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Tate,</salute></opener>
<p>Thanks for your kind 
<lb/>letter of 24th.</p>
<p>I wish I had been at the 
<lb/>funeral, if only to show my 
<lb/>regard and respect for the brave and kind 
<lb/>old man. It was however almost 
<lb/>impossible for me to make the 
<lb/>journey.</p>
<p>As regards his affairs, I have 
<lb/>no status whatever, and I have no 
<lb/>knowledge. The only time that he
<lb/> ever took me into his confidence was
        
    

    
         
        <pb n="5497" facs="#L1916_2160_img_5497"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>at my last visit to him in August '06.
<lb/>All he said was that <sic>Scottie</sic> would, at
<lb/> his death, come on the <sic>S.M.T.</sic> fund
<lb/> for £200 a year, and that he had, on
<lb/> Jim Roche's death, fixed her allowance
<lb/> at that figure, but that she had always
<lb/> exceeded it. That did not surprise
<lb/> me because I had some experiences of
 <sic>Scottie</sic> in India.</p>
<p>I went on to Cork, and was so
<lb/> much dissatisfied with what I saw
<lb/> there, that I wrote to him, rather
<lb/> forcibly, about the children <unclear>8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi></unclear>. In 
<lb/>his reply he gave me some figures of 
<lb/><sic>Scottie's</sic> expenditure, which did as
<lb/>tonish me. Naturally I surmise, 
<lb/>from your reference to <sic>Scottie's</sic> debts,
        
    
         
        <pb n="5498" facs="#L1916_2160_img_5498"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>that the <unclear>sublime</unclear> in (?) 1913, was due
<lb/> to further calls upon him. With what
<lb/> her second husband left, with the children's
<lb/> allowance from the Queen's fund, and
<lb/> with the £200 from the <sic>S.M.B.</sic> fund,
<lb/> we may feel confident that <sic>Scottie</sic> is
<lb/> well provided for, and that she will go
<lb/> on piling up debts for the rest of her 
<lb/>life.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I cannot help you in
 <lb/>regard to the name of W. Robertson's
 <lb/>mother. <unclear>Louie</unclear> told me the little I know
<lb/> about her family. The <unclear>paucity</unclear> of her
<lb/> relations was due, I believe, to the fact
<lb/> that her father, and his father were only
<lb/> children, and her mother one of two.
<lb/> She would be pleased that the Johnston
<lb/> family get so little.</p>
<p>You may be quite sure that the
<lb/> will will not be disputed. It was just
<lb/> to leave most to Mabel.</p>
        
    
         
        <pb n="5499" facs="#L1916_2160_img_5499"/>
        
        
           
            <p>I cannot clearly recollect <sic>Ballycastle</sic>
<lb/> I sincerely hope that the change has done
<lb/> your baby good, and that she will soon
<lb/> be quite well. Also that Alec will soon
<lb/> be fit again. She and I have reached an
<lb/> age. My trouble is <sic>stomachic.</sic></p>
<p>I cannot sufficiently praise you
<lb/> for sacrificing yourself as you have done,
<lb/> and returning to Abbotsleigh, to help
<lb/> Mabel. Now, I conclude, the executors
<lb/> will attend to every matter.</p>
<p>Yes, I fear that we are too far
<lb/> apart geographically, to be likely to meet.
<lb/> If- as seems possible, my interest in Rubber
<lb/> and coconuts turns out well, we would let
<lb/> our house for a while - but our <unclear>sojourn</unclear> would
<lb/> be in Italy. Nevertheless we shall continue
<lb/> to hope for a visit from you &amp; the girls.</p>

<closer><salute>With very kind regards,
<lb/>Yours sincerely,</salute>
<signed>David Leighton.</signed></closer>
