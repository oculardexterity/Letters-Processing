                            <p>This is a printed pamphlet of a letter by Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916), Robert Montieth (1879-1956) and Daniel Julian Bailey (aka Sergeant Beverly) in English and German. The letter was to inform the Irish recruits that they would be leaving and to explain why they would not fight. </p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>Casement had spent eighteen months in Germany attempting to secure German support for an uprising in Ireland and raising an ultimately unsuccessful brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps. By the time the farewell letter was written, Casement had been become disillusioned with German assistance and marginalised from the plans for the Rising. He believed there should be no rising without sufficient German support and when he realised that it was going ahead with only a small supply of German arms, he traveled to Ireland to prevent it from taking place. The Germans supplied a submarine to transport Casement, Monteith and Beverly to Ireland but Casement and Beverly were captured after they landed in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. Casement was hanged for treason in London in August 1916.</p>

Comrades of the Irish Brigade!
We are going away on a very perilous journey and have been forced to leave you without a word of farewell or explanation - It was not possible to tell you any thing or to explain then or even now fully why we did not bring you with us.

One reason, perhaps the chief reason why you are not accompanying us to day is to keep you out of the very grave danger we have to face - We are sure that many of you, perhaps all of you would have gladly faced those dangers too, seeing that it is in the cause of Ireland we go; but we have decided it was unfair to you to appeal to Your courage in a matter where all the elements of danger are very apparent and those of hope entirely wanting - You mus therefore forgive us for going in silence from you and leaving you to the continued idleness and inactivity that have already been so harmful to you and contrary to your hopes when you volunteered for the service of Ireland.

Should we live you will know and understand all; if we do not return or you hear no more of us you will know we have gone to do our part in our country's cause according to what we feel was right.
When the war is over your many friends in America will certainly have you in their care and affection. Meantime you may have many hard and unhappy days to face, many trials

<p>We are going away on a very perilous<lb/> journey and have been forced to leave you<lb/> without a word of farewell or explanation - It<lb/> was not possible to tell you any thing or to<lb/> explain then or even now fully why we did not<lb/> bring you with us.<lb/></p>
<p>One reason, perhaps the chief reason why<lb/> you are not accompanying us to day is to keep<lb/> you out of the very grave danger we have to<lb/> face &#x2014; We are sure that many of you, perhaps<lb/> all of you would have gladly faced those dangers<lb/> too, seeing that it is in the cause of Ireland we<lb/> go; but we have decided it was unfair to you<lb/> to appeal to Your courage in a matter where<lb/> all the elements of danger are very apparent<lb/> and those of hope entirely wanting &#x2014; You must<lb/> therefore forgive us for going in silence from<lb/> you and leaving you to the continued idleness<lb/> and inactivity that have already been so harmful<lb/> to you and contrary to your hopes when<lb/> you volunteered for the service of Ireland.<lb/></p>
<p>Should we live you will know and understand<lb/> all; if we do not return or you hear no<lb/> more of us you will know we have gone to do<lb/> our part in our country's cause according to<lb/> what we feel was right.<lb/></p>
When the war is over your many friends in<lb/> America will certainly have you in their care<lb/> and affection. Meantime you may have many<lb/> hard and unhappy days to face, many trials<lb/><pb/>

<date>Berlin, 11 April 1916.</date>
<lb/>To the Non Commissioned <sic>Offiziers</sic> and
<lb/> Men of the Irish Brigade at Zossen.
<salute>Comrades
<lb/> of the Irish Brigade!</salute>
<p>We are going away on a very perilous
<lb/> journey and have been forced to leave you
<lb/> without a word of farewell or explanation &#x2014;It
<lb/> was not possible to tell you any thing or to
<lb/> explain then or even now fully why we did not
<lb/> bring you with us.</p>
<p>One reason, perhaps the chief reason why
<lb/> you are not accompanying us to day is to keep
<lb/> you out of the very grave danger we have to
<lb/> face &#x2014; We are sure that many of you, perhaps
<lb/> all of you would have gladly faced those dangers
<lb/> too, seeing that it is in the cause of Ireland we
<lb/> go; but we have decided it was unfair to you
<lb/> to appeal to Your courage in a matter where
<lb/> all the elements of danger are very apparent
<lb/> and those of hope entirely wanting &#x2014; You must
<lb/> therefore forgive us for going in silence from
<lb/> you and leaving you to the continued idleness
<lb/> and inactivity that have already been so harmful
<lb/> to you and contrary to your hopes when
<lb/> you volunteered for the service of Ireland.</p>
<p>Should we live you will know and understand
<lb/> all; if we do not return or you hear no
<lb/> more of us you will know we have gone to do
<lb/> our part in our country's cause according to
<lb/> what we feel was right.</p>
<p>When the war is over your many friends in
<lb/> America will certainly have you in their care
<lb/> and affection. Meantime you may have many
<lb/> hard and unhappy days to face, many trials
        
    
         
        <pb n="1261" facs="#L1916_456_img_1261"/>
        
        
           
            <lb/>and temptations too and perhaps harsh things
<lb/> to bear.</p>
<p>Bear all with brave stout Irish hearts thinking
<lb/> that in what you did you <sic>sougth</sic>to serve
<lb/> your country and that no man could give, to
<lb/> that cause more than you gave.</p>
<p>You gave yourselves &#x2014; Having given Yourselves
<lb/> so freely.</p>
<p>Keep yourself bravely.</p>
 <p>Be obedient, disciplined and patient, and
<lb/> rest assured that what ever happens to us we
<lb/> are going from you to day you will find many
<lb/> friends in the world and your names will be
<lb/> honoured still in Irish story.</p>

<add>A weak hearted Irishman at best. 
<lb/>Fact pointed out to R.C., but Monteith would 
<lb/>have no other, seemingly on account of his 12 years 
<lb/>military experiences. 
<lb/>Monteith's reason is even today a mystery 
<lb/>to M.P.K. for so doing. I hope one day to see 
<lb/>Monteith re same</add>
