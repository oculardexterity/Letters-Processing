                            <p>A letter from Olive Duffin to her sister Ruth. In this letter Olive discusses how her sisters Emma (1883-1979) and Dorothy are getting on, specifically travel arrangements and Dorothy’s new job with the admiralty. Olive also mentions a possible job for Marjorie as a female chauffeur. Olive offers to enclose the prospectus for the driving school with her letter.</p>
                            
                        
                            
                        
                            
                            <p>This letter is part of a rich correspondence between various members of the Duffin family, a large prosperous family living in Strandtown, Belfast. Several family members served in the war, including Major Terence Duffin, who was a staff officer with 107 Brigade, and later with Royal Irish Rifles; Major Charles G Duffin MC, Royal Field Artillery; and their sisters Emma, Celia and Dorothy who served as Voluntary Aid Detachments (VADS) in Egypt and France, and with the YMCA.</p>

<salute>My dear Ruth,</salute><lb/>
<p>I suppose Emma has got home by now but she must have had <lb/>an awful journey as the railways are still all blocked as the result of <lb/>the storm. We did not get the worst of it here, but it was bad enough <lb/>and I am thankful this morning it is much warmer and looks as if <sic>thar</sic> <lb/>weather was really over and there might be a chance of Spring at last.</p><lb/>
<p>I heard from Dorothy this morning, poor thing she is I am sure in an <lb/>awful fright but I am so pleased to hear she happened by a bit of luck <lb/>to hear of the lady wanting a tenant for a room in her flat for it sounds <lb/>much nicer than a boarding house or hostel and is very cheap, and if <lb/>the other people turned out decent it would be some company.</p><lb/>
<p>Of course the hours and the pay are very bad and would really not be <lb/>worth keeping unless there was some chance of promotion, but it will be <lb/>a kind of trial trip and <sic>experienceand</sic> may lead to something else. <lb/>I've been making all enquiries I can for some time now, asking everyone <lb/>about work and spay and conditions and it is very discouraging, all the <lb/>hours are terribly long and pay not capable of being lived upon under <lb/>present conditions, rooms very hard to find.</p><lb/>
<sic>Hve</sic> you any idea of what Marjorie thinks of doing? Or what she <lb/>would like to do. Do you think she would care to come to London and <lb/>take this course of training in motor mechanism and driving? I enclose <lb/>the prospectus. I know she is interested in it and it might just be <lb/>an occupation for her for a time. I am awfully taken with it and would <lb/>love to do it, the fees are very low and the whole thing sounds most <lb/><pb/>

<p>I suppose Emma has got home by now but she must have had <lb/>
an awful journey as the railways are still all blocked as the result of <lb/>
the storm. We did not get the worst of it here, but it was bad enough <lb/>
and I am thankful this morning it is much warmer and looks as if <sic>thar</sic> <lb/>
weather was really over and there might be a chance of Spring at last.</p>
<p>I heard from Dorothy this morning, poor thing she is I am sure in an <lb/>
awful fright but I am so pleased to hear she happened by a bit of luck <lb/>
to hear of the lady wanting a tenant for a room in her flat for it sounds <lb/>
much nicer than a boarding house or hostel and is very cheap, and if <lb/>
the other people turned out decent it would be some company.</p> 
<p>Of course the hours and the pay are very bad and would really not be <lb/>
worth keeping unless there was some chance of promotion, but it will be <lb/>
a kind of trial trip and <sic>experienceand</sic> may lead to something else.</p> 
I've been making all enquiries I can for some time now , asking everyone <lb/>
about work and pay and conditions and it is very discouraging, all the <lb/>
hours are terribly long and pay not capable of being lived upon under <lb/>
present conditions, rooms very hard to find.</p>
<p><sic>Hve</sic> you any idea of what Marjorie thinks of doing? Or what she <lb/>

take this course of training in motor mechanism and driving<unclear>?</unclear> I enclose <lb/>

<salute>My dear Ruth,</salute></opener>
<p>I suppose Emma has got home by now but she must have had <lb/>
an awful journey as the railways are still all blocked as the result of <lb/>
the storm. We did not get the worst of it here, but it was bad enough <lb/>
and I am thankful this morning it is much warmer and looks as if <sic>thar</sic> <lb/>
weather was really over and there might be a chance of Spring at last.</p>
<p>I heard from Dorothy this morning, poor thing she is I am sure in an <lb/>
awful fright but I am so pleased to hear she happened by a bit of luck <lb/>
to hear of the lady wanting a tenant for a room in her flat for it sounds <lb/>
much nicer than a boarding house or hostel and is very cheap, and if <lb/>
the other people turned out decent it would be some company.</p> 
<p>Of course the hours and the pay are very bad and would really not be <lb/>
worth keeping unless there was some chance of promotion, but it will be <lb/>
a kind of trial trip and <sic>experienceand</sic> may lead to something else.</p> 
I've been making all enquiries I can for some time now , asking everyone <lb/>
about work and pay and conditions and it is very discouraging, all the <lb/>
hours are terribly long and pay not capable of being lived upon under <lb/>
present conditions, rooms very hard to find.</p>
<p><sic>Hve</sic> you any idea of what Marjorie thinks of doing? Or what she <lb/>
would like to do. Do you think she would care to come to London and <lb/>
take this course of training in motor mechanism and driving<unclear>?</unclear> I enclose <lb/>
the prospectus. I know she is interested in it and it might just be <lb/>
an occupation for her for a time. I am awfully taken with it and would <lb/>
love to do it , the fees are very low and the whole thing sounds most

            <lb/>businesslike. It <sic>semms</sic> that women chauffeuses are really wanted now 
<lb/>and it would be very useful to know. I think it is quite possible that 
<lb/>I could arrange with Miss Roberts to leave for a time even if not for 
<lb/>altogether, she can always get odd friends to come especially in the <del>summ</del> 
<lb/>summer and she likes nothing so much as a variety. May Darbyshire is 
<lb/>coming to her on the 15th for a fortnight so I shall be on the loose then.</p> 
<p>I have <sic>alittle</sic> money in hand and then there will be the £50 and it 
<lb/>might not be a bad investment. Anyhow will you study the enclosed and 
<lb/>also sound Marjorie as to what she thinks , it might just be the distraction 
<lb/>she needs, but I have heard so little I <sic>dont</sic>  know what her ideas may 
<lb/>be. Tell her I have also discovered a First Aid Yeomanry Nursing Corps 
<lb/>which sends members abroad in different capacities, paying a small sum for 
<lb/>themselves.</p>
<p>I am just off now to pick tow at the Depot, a very wearisome 
<lb/>job! Do you know what is a good speed at <sic>typeing</sic> I can do 1800 
<lb/>an hour now but not with great accuracy?</p>
<closer><salute>Much love to all 
<lb/>Yours ever</salute>
<signed>Olive.</signed></closer>
<note>P.S. Tell Emma I forgot she owed me ten shillings but I think she paid 
<lb/>some things I forgot about too. I wish you were having a little
<lb/> change for your holiday.</note>
<note>Return papers <hi rend="underline">please</hi>.</note>
