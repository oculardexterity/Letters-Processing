                            <p>A letter from Hugh Law (1872-1943) to a Miss Griffin. Law is responding to a letter written by a Miss Griffin on behalf of Desmond Fitzgerald (1888-1947). Mr. Law agrees that Fitzgerald's sentence is very severe but that there is very little chance of getting sentences revised yet. He does think that later it should be possible to do something - at least for those who hadn't taken an active part. He will discuss it with his colleagues in London next month. He concludes by mentioning that all of his children are well, including his son who has spent nearly a year on the French front.</p>
                        
                            <p>Hugh Law was an Irish nationalist MP representing County Donegal in the British House of Commons from 1902 to 1918, and subsequently served as a TD in Dáil Éireann. Desmond Fitzgerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Mountjoy, Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.</p>
