                            <p>Letter from Caitlín Ní Shéaghda to Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947). The writer sympathises with Mrs FitzGerald on the severity of her husband's sentence. She enquires as to how the prisoners are treated and she asks for news of Blythe (Ernest Blythe, 1889-1975). She has heard that Mrs.O'Rahilly, widow of The O'Rahilly (1875-1916) who was killed in the fighting on 29 April 1916, gave birth to a son recently and wants confirmation.</p>
                        
                            <p>Mabel was a former governess in London. She later vigorously canvassed her former acquaintances in London's liberal circles for support for Francis Sheehy Skeffington during his hunger strike in 1915. Both Mabel and Desmond would serve in the GPO garrison during Easter Week.</p>

Bridge Street, Dingle May 30th 1916  Dear Mrs.Fitzgerald Please excuse me for not writing sooner. I was very sorry for the long sentence Desmond got but things could be worse for you though they are bad enough. How must you feel at all? You poor creature you must feel terrible and ye were so devoted to each other. But what of poor Desmond's feelings they must be terrible
