                            <p>This letter is from Catherine Wheelwright (née Coll) (1858-1932) to her son Fr Thomas Wheelwright (1890-1946). She writes from Rochdale, New York concerning the Easter Rising and Éamon's involvement. She tells of the various influential contacts she has made in America on his behalf.</p>
                        
                            <p> Catherine Wheelwright was the mother of Éamon de Valera (1882-1975), teacher, revolutionary and politician and Fr Wheelwright was her son and de Valera's half brother. Éamon de Valera had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and was adjutant to Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), Dublin Brigade commandant. He went on to command forces at Bolands Mill during the Rising and was the most senior participant to escape execution. De Valera would go on to become one of the most influential figures in Ireland's 20th century.  </p>

Now please if <lb/> you have Sinead's and Uncle <lb/> Patt's letters send them to me. <lb/>  There can't be much in them <lb/>to upset me. I have realized <lb/> all the facts about Eddie <lb/>since I saw in the papers <lb/> about the Sinn Fein uprising <lb/> I knew he couldn't escape <lb/> the authorities over there when <lb/> he was a Professor of Gaelic  <lb/>in Dublin University.

            <lb/>hoped Almighty God in His mercy <lb/> would save him from an unexpected <lb/> or sudden death or from a prison <lb/> cell.  However May His Holy Will <lb/> be done.  I went to see Chief Quigley <lb/> yesterday.  he sent me to a Mr McCarthy <lb/> who has charge here of the Sinn Fein <lb/> movement in U.S.  I gave him some <lb/> old letters of Ed's also copy of Birth <lb/> Certificate and all particulars, he <lb/> told <add>me</add> a Mr Moore was coming here <lb/> in a few days and he would <lb/> shown them and consult with <lb/> him.  Mr Moore is National Secretary <lb/> of the organisation. Mr McCarthy got <lb/> a letter from Post Master Buckley <lb/> saying Senator Wadsworth would

I saw <lb/> Mr Whitney and he said he would <lb/> write to Congressman Danforth <lb/> today and he would tell us what <lb/> to do.  I am sorry I didn't know about <lb/> it sooner for I can do more than <lb/> you are aware of.  You ought <add>to</add> know <lb/> although I am frail now Almighty <lb/> God has given me nerves of <lb/> steel and in His Mercy given <lb/> me a peculiar mind, if I must <lb/> say so.
