                            <p>A letter from Eoin C. Mac Giolla Comhghall to Nancy O'Rahilly (1875-1961). The writer (a Catholic Priest) has just heard that Mrs.O'Rahilly has given birth to a son and describes the event as 'added glory for the hero who has fallen'. He promises to remember the family in his Masses and he says that the women related to these brave men  'ought to be the proudest women on Erin's soil today'.  Finally he congratulates 'little Michael Joseph' and hopes he will take his great father's place for his mother and for Ireland.</p>
                        
                            <p>Nancy O'Rahilly was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly (1875-1916). The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death – the child was born three months later. </p>
