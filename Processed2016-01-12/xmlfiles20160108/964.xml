                            <p>Letter from Hanna Sheehy Skeffington (1877-1946) to John Dillon (1851-1927). Sheehy Skeffington writes about an 'Aliens Form' which she is expected to complete. Mrs. Schmutz, her landlady, has been told that she will be liable to penalties if Hanna fails to complete it. The landlady is also obliged to report to the police any time Hanna leaves and give details of her address, luggage etc. She points out that the parts of the form she is expected to complete refer to aliens and that none of the other lodgers have ever been asked to provide this information. She has written to the authorities to complain but has received no reply. Enclosed are the forms referred to in the letter.</p>
                        
                            <p>Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, suffragette, nationalist, language teacher, was the widow of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington (who was summarily executed on 26 April 1916). She was active during the Rising, bringing food to the Volunteers in the G.P.O. and the College of Surgeons. Four days passed before she found out what had happened to her husband, Francis (1878-1916), and it wasn't until almost two weeks later that the full details of his execution emerged.</p>
                        
                            <p>John Dillon was an Irish Party MP in the House of Commons. In a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down “with so much blood and so much savagery”, and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Mrs.Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to the incident and raids on her home.</p>

<address> 43 Moyne Rd <lb/> Ranelagh <lb/> <date> 21 . 10 . 16 <lb/> <salute> Dear Mr Dillon, <lb/> <p>paragraph</p> Since visiting you the other day I <lb/> have obtained copy of the form which <lb/> the "Aliens" officer apparently expects me <lb/> to fill in.

None of the other lodgers that <lb/> have stayed here have ever been asked <lb/> to fill them in. I have written to the authorities <lb/> complaining about the matter, but have re- <lb/> ceived no reply. <lb/> Yours Sincerely <lb/> Hanna Sheehy Skeffington

None of the other lodgers that  <lb/> have stayed here have ever been asked  <lb/> to fill them in. I have written the authorities  <lb/> complaining about the matter, but have re- <lb/>ceived no reply.</p>   <salute>Yours Sincerely</salute>  <signed> <hi rend="underline">Hanna Sheehy Skeffington</hi>. </signed>
