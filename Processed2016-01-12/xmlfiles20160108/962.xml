                            <p>A letter from Major Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher-Vane (1861-1934) to John Dillon (1851-1927). Vane was in command of Portobello Barracks during the Rising. He says that he should have obtained an important command on foot of his participation in an attack on the rebels at the South Dublin Union, for which re received a commendation from Colonel Maconchie. Instead, he believes, because he reported the murder of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and others, he was punished by being thrown out of the army. He feels that in reporting the murders he has done a service to Ireland and England by exposing 'villainy in high places' and now he wants the National Party to get him his rights. He encloses a statement of his case.</p>
                        
                            <p>Major Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher-Vane was a British officer in command of Portobello Barracks. When he learned about activities of Captain J.C.Bowen-Colthurst he reported the matter to his superiors but, sensing a cover-up, he went to London and reported to Lord Kitchener and Maurice Bonham Carter, Private Secretary to the Prime Minister. Although Bowen-Colthurst was court-martialed and found guilty, Vane was that he was 'retired' from the military for his actions.</p>
                        
                            <p>  John Dillon was an Irish Party M.P. in the House of Commons. In a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down “with so much blood and so much savagery”, and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Mrs.Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to the incident and raids on her home.  </p>

A CASE FOR INQUIRY ADMITTED FACTS AND DOCUMENTS IN  CASE OF MAJOR SIR FRANCIS VANE, Bt.  I was training men of Royal Munster Fusiliers from October 1915, (when the Battalion was raised) to October 1915, the eve of the departure of the battalion for the front. March 1915. (six months after I joined) General Parsons reported officially <hi rend="underline">Major Sir Francis Vane is an energetic officer with a happy knack in dealing with and training recruits</hi>. (This is on record an the copy can be seen.) 30th April 1915.  Lieutenant Colonel H.F.Williams wrote me a Letter to show at War Office <hi rend="underline">Major Sir F.

I made a recruiting speech in which I declared myself a nationalist obtaining 50 recruits. For this i was severely reprimanded by General Parsons by letter in violent terms.  He saying that <hi rend="underline">on account of this speech I was unfit to command men.</hi> I strongly protested that against this reprimand and demanded a court martial. This was refused. In October 1915. General Parsons wrote an unfavourable report on me in which such irrelevant terms as <hi rend="underline">very conceited, a crank</hi>, etc., occurred. On this the Army Council called upon me to resign which refused to do demanding a court of inquiry and I had a question put in the house  by Mr. Charles Duncan. <hi rend="underline">Between November, 1915 and January 1916, the three officers who had reported against me, General Parsons, Brigadier General Buchanan and Colonel H.F.Williams, were removed from their command.</hi> <hi rend="underline">January 15th, 1916.

<p><hi rend="underline">A CASE FOR INQUIRY </hi><lb/>ADMITTED FACTS AND DOCUMENTS <lb/><hi rend="underline">IN  CASE OF MAJOR SIR FRANCIS VANE, Bt.</hi></p>  <p>I was training men of Royal Munster Fusiliers from October  <lb/>1914, (when the Battalion was raised) to October 1915, the eve of <lb/> the departure of the battalion for the front.</p> <p>March 1915. (six months after I joined) General Parsons  <lb/>reported officially <hi rend="underline">Major Sir Francis Vane is an energetic officer <lb/> with a happy knack in dealing with and training recruits</hi>. (This is on record and the copy can be seen.)</p> <p>30th April 1915.  Lieutenant Colonel H.F.Williams wrote me a  <lb/>Letter to show at War Office <hi rend="underline">Major Sir F. Vane has been training <lb/> with this battalion for seven months and has worked most zealously <lb/>never sparing himself in very trying weather</hi>. (this letter can <lb/> be seen.)</p> <p>End of March 1915. I made a recruiting speech in which I <lb/>declared myself a nationalist obtaining 50 recruits. For this I <lb/> was severely reprimanded by General Parsons by letter in violent <lb/> terms.  He saying that <hi rend="underline">on account of this speech I was unfit to  <lb/>command men.</hi> I strongly protested that against this reprimand and  <lb/>demanded a court martial. This was refused.</p> <p>In October 1915. General Parsons wrote an unfavourable <lb/>report on me in which such irrelevant terms as <hi rend="underline">very conceited, a  <lb/>crank</hi>, etc., occurred.</p> <p>On this the Army Council called upon me to resign which I <lb/> refused to do demanding a court of inquiry and I had a question <lb/> put in the house  by Mr. Charles Duncan</p>. <p><hi rend="underline">Between November, 1915 and January 1916, the three officers <lb/> who had reported against me, General Parsons, Brigadier General <lb/> Buchanan and Colonel H.F.Williams, were removed from their command.</hi></p> <p><hi rend="underline">January 15th, 1916.

Through exertions of Rt.Hon.H.J. <lb/> Tennant I was regazetted as recruiting officer in Ireland. 24th April, 1916. I volunteered and was gazetted for the rebellion.</p> <p>27th April, 1916.

Colonel Maconchie, C.B. C.I.E.

I reported personally to Lord Kitchener the <lb/> murders of <hi rend="underline">Messrs Skeffington, Dickson &amp; McIntyre</hi> by Captain <lb/> Colthurst and was commended for reporting.</p> <p>26th May, 1916. I received orders to leave Ireland and <lb/> report in London for General Maxwell.</p> <p>30th June, 1916.

(six months after I joined) General Parsons  <lb/>reported officially <hi rend="underline">Major Sir Francis Vane is an energetic officer <lb/> with a happy knack in dealing with and training recruits</hi>. (This is on record and the copy can be seen.)</p> <p>30th April 1915.  Lieutenant Colonel H.F.Williams wrote me a  <lb/>Letter to show at War Office <hi rend="underline">Major Sir F. Vane has been training <lb/> with this battalion for seven months and has worked most zealously <lb/>never sparing himself in very trying weather</hi>. (this letter can <lb/> be seen.)</p> <p>End of March 1915. I made a recruiting speech in which I <lb/>declared myself a nationalist obtaining 50 recruits. For this I <lb/> was severely reprimanded by General Parsons by letter in violent <lb/> terms.  He saying that <hi rend="underline">on account of this speech I was unfit to  <lb/>command men.</hi> I strongly protested that against this reprimand and  <lb/>demanded a court martial. This was refused.</p> <p>In October 1915. General Parsons wrote an unfavourable <lb/>report on me in which such irrelevant terms as <hi rend="underline">very conceited, a  <lb/>crank</hi>, etc., occurred.</p> <p>On this the Army Council called upon me to resign which I <lb/> refused to do demanding a court of inquiry and I had a question <lb/> put in the house  by Mr. Charles Duncan</p>. <p><hi rend="underline">Between November, 1915 and January 1916, the three officers <lb/> who had reported against me, General Parsons, Brigadier General <lb/> Buchanan and Colonel H.F.Williams, were removed from their command.</hi></p> <p><hi rend="underline">January 15th, 1916.

Through exertions of Rt.Hon.H.J. <lb/> Tennant I was regazetted as recruiting officer in Ireland. 24th April, 1916. I volunteered and was gazetted for the rebellion.</p> <p>27th April, 1916.

General L.B.Friend wrote <lb/> to me, "<hi rend="underline">I hasten to inform you that your conduct on the 27th <lb/> April, as reported by Colonel Maconchie, will be brought before <lb/> General Sir John Maxwell now commanding the forces in Ireland, <lb/> together with other recommendations of a similar kind.</hi>"</p> <p>3rd May, 1916. I reported personally to Lord Kitchener the <lb/> murders of <hi rend="underline">Messrs Skeffington, Dickson &amp; McIntyre</hi> by Captain <lb/> Colthurst and was commended for reporting.</p> <p>26th May, 1916. I received orders to leave Ireland and <lb/> report in London for General Maxwell.</p> <p>30th June, 1916.
